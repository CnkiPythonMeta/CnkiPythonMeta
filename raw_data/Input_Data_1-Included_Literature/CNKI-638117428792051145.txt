外文会议	The Exploration of the New Mode of Medical Consortium under the Development of Modern Internet Technology	Liangqiu Xu;Siqi Lv;Junhao Liu;Yanzhe Liu;Ying LI		"2020 3rd International Conference on Computer Science, Electronics and Engineering Management"	Medical consortium;Telemedicine;Block chain;Regional medical information integration	"The government work report for 2020 clearly points out that China needs to develop “Internet plus medical health”. However, the current medical consortium is facing a series of problems: high operating costs due to internal geographical isolation, and low efficiency of medical data management and sharing. Under the current Internet technology conditions, these problems can be solved by using telemedicine technology to break geographical isolation and thus reduce operating costs. Blockchain can also be used to realize low-cost and safe storage and sharing of medical data. This paper aims to analyze the development pain points and causes of medical consortium in China, and reshape the new model of medical consortium by virtue of the advantages of telemedicine and blockchain which are subversive to the medical industry."	2020-12-01	2020

International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health	Medical alliance;;Healthcare;;Doctor preference	"This cross-sectional survey study explored whether doctors in Guangdong, China preferred to provide extra healthcare services within the context of their medical alliances (MAs). Specifically, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted to investigate whether doctors preferred to provide extra services at low-tier hospitals within their MAs. A literature review, focus group interview, and expert group discussion resulted in three main attributes (i.e., working time, income, and hospital location) and corresponding levels, which were combined to create 24 profiles that were randomly presented to participants. A conditional logit model was then employed to calculate utility scores for all profiles. A total of 311 doctors completed the DCE questionnaire. The coefficients for each level within the three attributes were ordered and found to be statistically significant. Working time had the greatest influence on utility scores, increasing by one hour per week (beta = 1.4, odds ratio (OR) = 4.07, p < 0.001), followed by income, which increased by 30% per month (beta = 1.19, OR = 3.3, p < 0.001). The utility scores for all profiles ranged between ?0.27 and 3.07. Findings indicated that participants made trade-offs with respect to providing extra services within their MAs. Furthermore, utility varied between different subpopulations."	2020-03-26	2020	7

Methods: The sample was randomly selected by the multi-stage sampling method. A structural questionnaire was used to collect data from participants age 60 and above in Shandong, China, during August 2017. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, chi-square test, and multinomial logistic regression. Results: Of 1198 participants who were hospitalized in the year before the survey, 28.7% self-initiated downward referral, and 33.9% were willing to accept downward referral after a doctor’s advice. Multinomial logistic regression results showed that self-rated health, treatment effect in primary medical institutions, preference for outpatient service, choice of inpatient service, general understanding of essential medicines, the cost of essential medicines after zero-markup policy, and satisfaction with essential medicines’ reimbursement policy significantly correlated with older adults’ willingness for downward referral. Conclusions: The proportion of older adults who self-initiated downward referral was less than one-third. Doctors’ advice plays an important role in willingness for downward referral. More attention should be paid to improving the treatment effect of primary medical institutions, increasing the benefits of zero-markup policy, and ensuring a high reimbursement for the downward referral to work alongside doctors’ advice."	2020-01-06	2020	1		
外文期刊	Analysis of the Impact of China’s Hierarchical Medical System and Online Appointment Diagnosis System on the Sustainable Development of Public Health: A Case Study of Shanghai	Xiaojuan Shen;Weixin Yang;Shaorong Sun		Sustainability	public health;sustainable development;hierarchical medical system;cellular automata;policy simulation	"In the study of the sustainable development of public health in China, academic circles have little to do with the unique hierarchical medical system and online appointment diagnosis system in China’s medical system. Therefore, based on the medical situation in Shanghai, China, in addition to the traditional dimension of medical expenses, this paper fully considers the impact of the current hierarchical medical policy, constructs a selection model for medical treatment behavior under the hierarchical medical system and online appointment diagnosis system, and carries out simulation analysis through the cellular automata grid dynamic model. This paper finds that the time-cost-oriented medical treatment behavior of Chinese patients will have different distribution under the current hierarchical medical system and online appointment diagnosis system. (1) When the medical treatment system neither allows online appointment nor referral, a large number of patients congregated in high-grade hospitals, with the most unreasonable distribution. (2) With the implementation of the system of allowing referral and online appointment, patients are gradually diverted to lower-grade hospitals or off-peak hours, and the distribution is relatively improved. (3) If the medical treatment system allows both referral and online appointment, the distribution of patients is the most reasonable. Therefore, China’s current hierarchical medical system and online appointment diagnosis system will, to a considerable extent, become a policy tool that affects patients’ choice of hospitals and an effective means to achieve the rational allocation of existing medical resources, which will play an important role in the sustainable development of public health in China."	2019-11-21	2019	23		
外文期刊	Spatial Inequity of Multi-Level Healthcare Services in a Rapid Expanding Immigrant City of China: A Case Study of Shenzhen	Wei Hu;;Lin Li;;Mo Su	"School of Resource and Environment Science, Wuhan University, 129 Luoyu Rd., Wuhan 430079, China; huwei_whu@whu.edu.cn (W.H.); mynameisyo@163.com (M.S.)"	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health	Healthcare services;;Inequity;;Accessibility;;Hierarchical medical system;;Shenzhen city	"Since the onset of reform and opening up in China, large cities in the nation have been experiencing problems related to limited medical resources. These resource limitations are due to rapid population growth and urban expansion. As the country’s fastest growing city, Shenzhen has experienced a substantial misalignment between the supply and the demand of healthcare services. Numerous researchers have analyzed spatial inequity in healthcare services by focusing on the spatial accessibility of medical facilities, such as hospitals, clinics, and community health service centers (CHSCs). However, the issue of inequity in healthcare services for vulnerable groups has largely been ignored. We chose general hospitals (GHs) and CHSCs, which provide direct healthcare services to residents, as the study objects. By performing spatial accessibility analysis using the gravity model and the two-step floating catchment area method, we investigated healthcare services inequity for vulnerable groups based on four dimensions: residential type, age, education level, and occupation. We found that the services provided by GHs cannot meet the demand in Shenzhen. This inadequacy is characterized by spatial centralization and neglect of those who reside in urban villages, who have low education levels, and who are employed in the manufacturing industry. In contrast, CHSCs generally serve a relatively broad population. This phenomenon is related to differences in the land and capital needs between GHs and CHSCs. Our study reveals that an appropriate adjustment of GH location could significantly improve healthcare services inequity. Therefore, to alleviate this inequity, it is particularly necessary to increase the number of GHs in the peripheral circle and in areas with large vulnerable populations, accelerate the implementation of the hierarchical medical system, and promote the transfer of medical resources to grassroot institutes through CHSCs. This study helps improve our understanding of healthcare services inequity in rapid expanding cities, which is of substantial significance for improving the planning and construction of medical facilities, facilitating scientific decision-making, and promoting social equity."	2019-09-17	2019	18

This study aimed to identify the factors affecting healthcare-seeking behavior among pregnant women in Guangdong, China.(#br)METHODS(#br)We conducted a cross-sectional, observational survey, developed using the Andersen's behavioral model. Pregnant women were randomly selected using a two-stage, stratified, random sampling method from hospitals in Guangdong, China. A multinomial logistic regression was used to identify statistically significant variables from aspect of environmental, demographic and pregnancy characteristics associated with pregnant women seeking healthcare at primary, secondary or tertiary hospitals.(#br)RESULTS(#br)A total of 1393 pregnant women returned the survey after attending 1 of 12 hospitals within 4 cities of the Guangdong province: 537 (38.5%) of the respondents attended a primary hospital, 437 (31.4%) a secondary hospital, and 419 (30.1%) a tertiary hospital. Women attending primary hospitals were more likely to live closer to the hospital, live rurally, and be educated to a lower level. Several factors were significantly associated with attendance at a secondary vs a primary hospital: the woman's perceived necessity to seek maternal healthcare (OR 1.73, 95% CI [1.1,2.74]), the woman's choice of delivery hospital (OR 1.45, 95% CI [1.01,2.07]), or urban living (OR 1.39, 95% CI [1.03,1.88]). Characteristics associated with attendance at a tertiary vs a primary hospital were: a history of pregnancy complications (OR 2.35, 95% CI [1.43,3.86]), travel to the hospital by public transport/taxi (OR 2.09/2.67, 95% CI [1.35,3.22]/ [1.45,4.92]), urban living (OR 1.58, 95% CI [1.14,2.18]), or a planned current pregnancy (OR 1.53, 95% CI [1.07,2.19]).(#br)CONCLUSION(#br)Medical needs and convenience both play a role in the choice of hospital for antenatal care, and impact on equity utilization of health services.

The International journal of health planning and management	Chronic disease;;Hierarchical medical system;;Medical resource;;Referral system;;Resource allocation efficiency	"In China, patients with chronic diseases have complete freedom to choose the medical institutions at which they are treated, which has resulted in wasted medical resources and increased medical expenses. The purpose of this study is to determine the effective mechanisms to incentivise patients with chronic diseases to obtain referrals from community health centres to tertiary hospitals and estimate the funds that could be saved using various mechanisms. Questionnaire research, expert consultations, and data simulation were applied. We surveyed 1824 outpatients at nine tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, and the results showed that the proportion of patients willing to obtain referrals was 48.4%. By increasing the registration fee, reducing the payment ratio of medical insurance, publicising, and rating the quality of community health centres, up to 51.3%, 50.6%, and 65.41% patients with chronic diseases indicated that they would obtain referrals, respectively. According to the 2015 Shanghai outpatient database, the funding that could be saved through these three mechanisms would be 361.67, 356.73, and 461.14 million yuan, respectively. We conclude that referral of patients with chronic diseases could reduce medical expenses and save medical insurance funds. Nevertheless, no single measure can effectively change patient habits. Comprehensive measures need to be applied to guide patient referral actively."	2019-07-22	2019	3

This reform has impacted the equity and spatial accessibility of healthcare resources in different regions. Taking Beijing as a case study, we calculated and compared the equity and accessibility of healthcare resources before and after referral reform with a three-stage two-step floating catchment area method. We set different referral rates and explored their effects on medical service accessibility and equity. The results showed that the referral reform improved total accessibility of public hospitals in Beijing, but at the same time aggravated the inequality of healthcare resource accessibility among towns and streets. Healthcare accessibility demonstrated a U shape with an increase in referral rates. After testing five scenarios, we conclude that a 90% referral rate from the secondary hospitals to tertiary hospitals could be a trade-off when the government strikes a balance between equal chance of access to health services and high accessibility."	2019-06-27	2019			
外文期刊	Case Mix Index weighted multi-objective optimization of inpatient bed allocation in general hospital	Jian Chang;;Lingjuan Zhang	The Second Military Medical UniversityShanghaiChina;Changhai Hospital Affiliated to the Second Military Medical UniversityShanghaiChina	Journal of Combinatorial Optimization	Bed allocation;Case Mix Index;Queueing theory;Multi-objective optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Hierarchical medical system	"Inpatient bed, as one of the most critical resources for general hospitals, has to be effectively allocated among different departments to achieve the goal of preferable balance between patient service and resource utilization. To address this issue, studies in the past have been focusing on the development of bed allocation optimization algorithms with the objective of improved patient admission rate or higher bed occupancy rate. But in the context of hierarchical medical system promoted by the medical reform currently ongoing in China, the level of disease severity or treatment difficulty of clinical cases also has to be involved in the evaluation of the hospital performance, especially for the highly ranked national-level general hospitals. Case Mix Index (CMI), as an internationally recognized index which is highly correlated with the level of clinical complexity, is thus introduced to evaluate hospitals uniformly and facilitate straightforward comparison among them. To be aligned with the new requirement for an improved CMI, a multi-objective comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper based on an upgraded queueing model which incorporates CMI as an important weight into the traditional optimization objectives. Experimental results indicate that a higher CMI can be achieved with the new method and meanwhile both patient admission rate and bed occupancy rate with which hospital managers are still concerned will not be much influenced. The method is developed for a tertiary public hospital in Shanghai and can also be applied by hospital managers in other hospitals of the similar scale."	2019-02-28	2019	1

The International journal of health planning and management	Geographic information system;;Medical consortium;;Pediatric;;Sphere of influence	"BACKGROUND(#br)To improve the utilization efficiency of health care services, the concept of a ""regional medical consortium"" has attracted more attention during the most recent round of health care reform in China. Shanghai, a municipality of China, has made many efforts to promote its regional medical consortium project. In this paper, the pediatric medical consortium of Shanghai will serve as an example to introduce the main tasks and groundwork of the Shanghai medical consortium and will underscore Shanghai's exploration of the vertical integration of medical resources.(#br)METHODS(#br)This study delimits the service areas of leading hospitals, which can help determine the spheres of influence of top hospitals geographically. With this information, regional hospitals or community hospitals can find alliance hospitals and leading hospitals more easily. These efforts can be realized using ArcGIS for spatial data analysis.(#br)RESULTS(#br)According to the locations of leading hospitals and actual patient distributions at these hospitals, the natural areas of influence of leading hospitals are illustrated. Then, hospitals other than leading hospitals can select allied hospitals in the same area of influence. In this way, connections in a medical consortium will be tighter, and hospitals will be better able to meet the actual demands of patients.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)In this paper, we introduce a geographic method to delimit the spheres of influence of hospitals based on actual health-seeking behaviors of patients by analyzing the spatial distribution of hospitalization probability. Within the boundaries of a sphere of influence, a geographic connection between the leading hospital and the general hospital is established automatically. Based on this geographic connection, leading hospitals should provide technological support to general hospitals located in their sphere of influence, while the general hospitals should provide spare medical resources in return. Thus, the medical consortium can be formed geographically and operate more smoothly."	2019-01-10	2019	1

CMFD2021	某三级综合医院门诊常见冠心病患者生活质量影响因素及健康管理策略分析	王D	中国人民解放军陆军军医大学	中国人民解放军陆军军医大学	心血管病;;健康管理;;生活质量评估;;预防;;策略	"目前估算全国有心血管病(CVD)患者2.9亿,其中高血压2.7亿、卒中1300万、冠心病(CAD)1100万,心血管疾病占居民疾病死亡构成比已经高于43%,超过肿瘤成为我国居民第一杀手,患病率及病死率仍处于持续上升阶段,且正加快向年轻人群蔓延。冠心病的死亡率占心血管疾病死亡率的43%,59%的患者就诊于三级医院,虽然目前我国冠心病的介入治疗水平已达国际先进水平,冠心病的死亡率仍然呈上升趋势。欧美发达国家的经验是使用健康管理的方法,遏制心血管病患病率和死亡率的增长。我国也非常重视心血管等慢性病的管理,但我国现有的以基层为重点的慢性病健康管理模式并未能在心血管疾病领域充分发挥遏制增长的作用。按照健康中国的战略,三级综合医院必须由D以治病为中心‖向D以健康为中心‖转变工作重心和工作方式,特别是对于数量巨大的三级综合医院门诊人群。1.研究目的秉持D战线前移‖的观念,打破慢病健康管理主要研究基层医疗机构、三级医院主要研究出院患者的传统模式,以人数最为集中和庞大的三级综合医院门诊患者为突破口,以提高三级综合医院门诊常见冠心病患者生活质量相关健康管理的效能为目的,提出相关策略建议,为三级综合医院心血管疾病的慢病管理提供思路依据,以期减少心血管疾病的(再)患病率、病死率。2.研究方法(1)问卷调查法:对某军医大学附属医院2017年10月至2018年1月就诊的342例新诊断为稳定型心绞痛的门诊患者进行横断面调查。通过36个短项目作为影响因子,评估了健康相关生活质量(HQRL)的八个维度,包括身体功能、身体问题导致的角色限制、身体疼痛、一般健康、活力、社会功能、情绪问题导致的角色限制和心理健康。采用多元逐步回归法评估了这些影响因子对患者生活质量评分的影响程度,探讨其与冠心病门诊患者的预测关系,重点发现可干预的影响因素。(2)文献分析法:为保障医学行为的安全性,对于医疗干预内容的文献,主要以指南、专家共识等文献为分析对象,通过知网、维普、联合国卫生组织(WHO)官网等数据库资源,以D心血管‖、D预防‖、D健康管理‖、D运动‖、D睡眠‖、D指南‖、D共识‖为主题或关键词,进行组合式搜索,同类指南选取最新版本。采用内容分析法对文献内容进行逐一归类,总结出干预内容及其优缺点。以D慢病管理‖为主题或关键检索并逐一阅读,筛查出与运行干预相关的有效文献;以D心血管健康管理‖、D三级综合医院‖、D三甲医院‖为主题或关键词检索并逐一阅读,筛查与运行干预相关的有效参考文献。通过百度搜索,以D三级医院‖、D健康管理‖主题检索,筛选出关于三级综合医院开展健康管理的报道。用内容分析法对文献内容进行逐一归类总结,总结归纳三级综合医院开展医疗干预的模式及其优缺点。(3)SWOT分析法:结合以上研究结果,根据影响冠心病患者HRQL的可干预因素和健康管理各个环节,列出并分析三级综合医院所面临的机遇与挑战、存在的优势与劣势,运用策略配对方法、专题小组讨论,以矩阵方式提出三级综合医院开展健康管理服务模式的SO、WO、ST和WT策略内容,选择重复率高的条目为优先策略建议。3.结果(1)年龄较大,女性,不运动,文化程度较低,月收入较低,吸烟/饮酒习惯以及患有糖尿病,高血压或高脂血症的患者的生理HRQL得分较低。生理健康状况与年龄、睡眠质量、运动习惯和月收入有关。文化程度较低,月收入较低的人的心理HRQL得分较低。心理健康状况与年龄、运动和月收入有关。较高的月收入、经常锻炼与较高的生理和心理HRQL分数相关。多元逐步回归分析的结果表明,身心HRQL与运动和月收入呈正相关,与年龄呈负相关。月收入≥5000元的患者的HRQL评分高于月收入<5000元的患者。睡眠质量和饮酒与身体的HRQL呈负相关,与精神的HRQL无关。(2)医疗机构干预“运动”和“睡眠”的干预内容:(1)不同心血管指南对于运动的描述侧重有所不同,主要分为运动定量指标的理论推荐和干预内容(包括定量指标和实施方法)。理论推荐的定量指标基本与心血管疾病的一级预防相关表述一致。(2)运动相关医疗干预方式主要有:教育-运动评估-心肺功能评估-危险分层-运动处方-运行处方原则-运动处方的实施。(3)干预内容的重点:CVD一级和二级预防均建议改善运动,建议临床医生既提供药物处方,也提供运动处方和帮助改善睡眠。在一定范围内运动强度越大心血管获益越大,但同时伴随运动风险增加。医生既要关注运动风险,又要关注患者的运动耐力下降,要及时采取措施来改善运动耐量。运动干预的目的是找到最有效且安全的运动阈值,长期坚持、动态评估并优化。医疗机构对心血管疾病的运动干预,正在被大家所接受,但仍需要推广。心血管病患者的运动与睡眠质量均需要专业的评估客观的量化以指导干预措施。睡眠不好既可以是一种生理疾病,也可以是一种心理疾病,要有针对性的采取不同的治疗方案。睡眠、心理、运动有很强的相关性,可见通过在心理、运动、睡眠三者之间任一因素的改善,另外两个因素都能正向改善。无论是运动干预还是睡眠干预,都需要患者良好的依从性。(3)医疗机构开展心血管疾病健康管理的模式:(1)美国、日本、芬国慢病的有效遏制,从全面筛查做起,得力于其强大的基层医疗系统和医疗保障体系,但因各种原因暂时无法在我国推广。(2)我国1997年颁布了《全国社区慢性非传染性疾病综合防治方案(试行)》将心血管疾病明确纳入慢性病管理范畴历经20余年探索,我国逐步形成了家庭签约、分级诊疗、区域医疗联合体、慢性病综合防控示范区等制度或服务模式,总体上是以政府为主导,以基层医疗卫生机构为重点,强调多部门参与,基本都涵盖了三级综合医院,管理对象为社区居民。(3)由于各级分工协作体制未能完全理顺,政府负担重等原因,多部门参与的模式推广度有限。(4)三级综合医院为依托的慢病健康管理模式,主要针对体检中的高危人群、门诊分诊人群和双向转诊人群。兼顾全科医师培养和社区人才培养的职能,为防治前移、主动下转和人才培养做出了贡献。(5)心血管专科为依托开展的健康管理模式,对象主要为出院患者,作为二级预防和延续治疗,目的在于提高患者治疗控制率,但会加重患者对三级综合医院的依赖度,也带来了人力资源的压力,急需同时加强医联体的建设和基层单位的能力建设,以加强下转效率。(6)“心脏康复”中心,似乎是一种最全面的心血管疾病健康管理模式,最大的特色就在于要求组建一支多学科的医疗团队,涵盖了运动处方和心理(睡眠)处方,但在我国开展尚待加强。(4)参与医联体、利用体检中心、加大健康管理相关宣传、帮助基层单位人才和能力建设、顺畅下转机制、开设“心脏康复中心”是三级综合医院门诊开展心血管病健康管理的较优策略。4.结论(1)运动、睡眠、收入,是可干预的影响冠心病患者健康相关生活质量的因素。(2)医疗机构应积极开展对心血管病患者的运动、睡眠的医疗干预,干预的安全性和有效性需要多个专业的医护人员和专业设施设备,科学的实施原则才能保障。同时,要通过各种手段提高患者对其的接受度,培养和提高患者的依从性。(3)我国现有以基层兜底的慢病管理模式,由于基层医疗机构能力和水平的限制,对心血管疾病患者的运动睡眠干预水平低,需要三级综合医院给予帮带才能参与到心血管疾病健康管理的环节中。(4)以三级综合医院为依托的健康管理模式和以心血管疾病专科为依托的健康管理模式,均能的覆盖运动和睡眠干预,特别是体检中心的健康门诊和心血管专科的健康门诊,但主要以健康教育为主,运动和睡眠的直接评估、干预少有涉及,但能起到很好健康评估和的健康教育作用。我国的“心脏康复中心”项目,是目前对于运动和睡眠管理团队最全面、体系最完整、目标最明确的健康管理模式,目前虽然主要针对出院患者,但其内容同样适用于门诊患者,应积极开展,并同时应用于门诊和住院患者。(5)三级综合医院门诊开展健康管理,不能只顾“健康干预”这一个环节,只有把整个健康管理的所有环节都搞好,才能有效的实施。5.策略建议(1)利用健康管理的理念,实现心血管疾病的三级预防。(2)加强居民冠心病健康管理认知和分级诊疗的宣传教育。(3)通过体检中心,加强冠心病的有效筛查和健康教育。(4)开展D以患者需求为中心‖的心血管健康门诊。(5)带头开展心脏康复,组建医联体,构建心脏康复三级网路设。(6)立全科医学科,做全科医生的培养摇篮和双向转诊的摆渡人。(7)将心血管健康管理项目纳入医保。"	2020-06-01	2020	01		10.27001/d.cnki.gtjyu.2020.000214
CMFD2021	利益视角下医联体分级诊疗多元主体的认知差异研究	陶士素	江西中医药大学	江西中医药大学	分级诊疗;;利益相关者;;认知差异;;政策建议	"研究背景与意义当前,无序就医已经成为“看病难、看病贵”的重要原因。为此,国家将分级诊疗作为当前医改的重中之重,并将医共体作为实现县域分级诊疗的重要抓手。而利益均衡是医联体可持续发展的关键,利益认知趋同则是实现益均衡的基础。为此,了解不同群体间的利益认知差异,探寻认知趋同策略成为促进医联体可持续发展的重要课题。但是,当前研究对于分级诊疗相关群体间认知的差异集中在制度认知差异上,对利益研究集中在利益冲突与损益分析上,缺少对各方在利益诉求等方面认知差异的比较。为此,研究拟在定性分析关键利益群体及其利益诉求的基础上,通过实证分析,明确医联体各相关利益群体的利益诉求认知差异,分析其影响因素,据此研制针对性的应对策略,促使各方认知趋同,促进医联体分级诊疗可持续发展。研究思路与方法首先,通过共词分析法确定医联体分级诊疗关键利益相关者。其次,结合WHO卫生系统绩效评价模型和ERG理论,定性分析关键利益相关者的利益诉求,并通过利益相关者定性访谈等方式修正、完善。再次,利用实证调查数据,分析关键利益相关者对各方利益诉求的认识差异及其影响因素。最后,根据影响因素,提出针对性认知趋同策略。结果1.关键利益相关者分析。共词分析发现,当前分级诊疗利益相关者研究中,提及频率前三位的分别是居民或患者、核心医疗机构(牵头机构、综合医院)及医务人员、成员医疗机构(基层医疗机构)及医务人员,分别为100%、83.3%、75.0%。据此,确定医联体分级诊疗关键利益群体是医方和患方,其中,医方包括综合医疗机构及其医务人员、基层医疗机构及其医务人员,患方指居民或患者。2.医患双方诉求的内容。通过理论分析和咨询论证,发现:医方的主要利益诉求点为薪酬待遇、安全责任、医患关系、职业发展和技术提升等方面;患方的主要利益诉求为安全、及时有效、经济、便捷等方面;双方利益诉求冲突集中在治疗决定权在谁手中、诊疗安全性还是医疗费用排第一等方面。3.医患双方对医生利益诉求的认知及差异状况。医方自评诉求排名前三位的依次为收入、业务量、个人职业发展,分别占30.5%、24.2%、16.8%;而患方认为医方诉求排名前三位的依次为收入、业务量、安全风险,分别占59.8%、19.6%、8.0%。分析发现:从性别上看,在业务量和职业发展诉求上,女性医务人员较男性医务人员关注度要低(P<0.05);在收入和安全方面的诉求较男性医务人员关注度要高(P<0.05)。从单位等级来看,级别越低的医疗机构对收入、业务量的关注度越高(P0.05)。4.医患双方对患方利益诉求的认知及差异状况。患方自评诉求排名前三位的依次为医疗费用、高效就医、医疗服务安全性,分别占50.9%、18.8%、17.9%;而医方认为患方诉求排名前三位的依次为医疗服务安全性、高效就医、医疗费用,分别占38.9%、25.3%、21.1%。影响因素有转诊经历、年龄、学历、收入等。同时患方认为医联体双向转诊制度的实施带来最大的变化是诊疗活动手续简单,而医方认为最大的变化是医疗服务的连续性。分析可知,从性别来看,男性患者和女性患者均对医疗的安全、有效,可及性关注度较高,连续性、尊严和保密性关注度较低(P<0.05)。中青年患者较年龄较大的患者对安全性和保密性、自主性和选择性等方面的诉求有显著差异(P0.05)。从学历分析,学历较高人群对尊严和保密性、自主性和选择性关注度较学历较低人群关注度高,学历较低的人群对可及性的关注度更高。从个人月收入来看,低收入人群对有效性、可及性的关注度较高,其他方面的关注度较低(P"	2020-06-01	2020	01		10.27180/d.cnki.gjxzc.2020.000017

CDFD2020	宁夏引导居民基层就诊的实施困境与仿真策略研究	苏源	山东大学	山东大学	分级诊疗;;基层医疗机构;;医疗服务能力;;医疗机构选择;;宁夏	"研究背景随着经济社会的发展,居民的健康风险和就医需求不断增加,对社会造成了较大的费用负担。2009年新医改提出了分级诊疗的内涵,并确立了“保基本本,强基层”改革目标,要求将一般性诊疗服务引导下沉至基层。国家政府及卫生部门各类政策文件中均强调实施分级诊疗制度和“强基层”的重要意义。2015年推进分级诊疗实施,要求加强基层医疗服务能力建设,建立医疗机构分工协作,提升医疗资源利用效率,使就医秩序更加合理规范。引导居民基层就诊是分级诊疗制度的本质和目标,与基层医疗服务能力互为因果。2016年宁夏成为全国综合医改试点省区,近年来在分级诊疗相关政策的实施、优化基层医疗机构资源投入、提高基层诊疗量等方面进行了诸多改革实践,但仍面临分级诊疗秩序进展缓慢、基层医疗服务能力薄弱、居民保持无序就医的困境,引导居民基层就诊的实施效果并不理想。优化改革实施效果需要来自科学研究的证据支持,问题背后的原因以及解决策略需要进一步分析与探究。分级诊疗相关策略实施过程中存在哪些问题?如何继续优化基层医疗资源配置?怎样提升基层诊疗服务利用是更有效的?居民基层就诊选择的关键因素有哪些?实施引导居民基层就诊仿真策略将对诊疗服务系统带来怎样的变化?期望基于本研究能够回答以上问题,以加快提升基层医疗服务能力,助力分级诊疗制度的有效推进。研究目的本文的总目标是以宁夏引导居民基层就诊的实施困境为出发点,从优化分级诊疗相关策略的实施效果、提升基层医疗服务能力、有效引导患者下沉的角度,尝试为卫生管理部门提供实证资料和参考依据。具体目标包括:1.从卫生政策的角度,梳理宁夏分级诊疗相关策略的实施现状与主要问题,为提升基层医疗服务体系的需求吸引能力提供理论依据;2.从供给侧服务能力的角度,分析基层医疗资源配置和诊疗服务利用的特征和薄弱环节,探讨基层医疗资源配置的公平性以及提升基层诊疗服务利用的区域策略,为改善基层医疗体系的服务提供能力和绩效产出结果提供决策支持;3.从需求侧就医行为的角度,分析居民基层就诊选择的偏好及影响因素,测算关键因素对基层就诊选择概率的边际影响,为建立良好就医秩序提供参考;4.从趋势预测的角度,构建基层就诊系统仿真模型,模拟和比较各类优化策略的实施效果,对进一步引导居民基层就诊可能面对的成效和问题形成预判。资料与方法1.资料来源:文献资料来源于各类中英文学术数据库,有关卫生政策文件来源于各级政府或部门的官方网站;相关卫生策略实施和基层医疗服务能力现状的定性资料来源于基层医疗机构知情人访谈信息;相关卫生策略实施进展以及宁夏和各地区医疗资源、诊疗服务利用等定量资料来源于2013-2018年《宁夏卫生健康工作统计公报》和宁夏卫健委信息中心;宁夏城乡居民个人信息、医疗服务利用等资料来源于2018年第六次宁夏卫生服务调查数据库;宁夏基本社会情况数据来源于2019年《宁夏统计年鉴》。2.分析方法:使用统计学方法对各类资料进行描述性分析、相关性分析和单因素检验等;利用熵权资源分布指数和集聚度指数评价各地区基层医疗资源配置的公平性;利用数据包络分析评价各地区基层诊疗服务利用效率;利用空间分析方法探讨基层诊疗服务利用的空间效应;构建随机效用模型测算关键因素对基层就诊选择概率的边际影响;利用系统动力学方法构建基层就诊系统仿真模型,模拟优化策略实施后的系统行为变化趋势。研究结果1.分级诊疗相关策略的实施现状及主要问题(1)阶梯化的门诊统筹报销制度对参加城乡居民医保的非慢性病患者前往基层就诊产生了一定引导效果。医保策略的主要问题包括,门诊大病医保制度未形成阶梯化报销比例;转诊转院制度对基层首诊的激励作用有待发挥;各级医疗机构间住院报销比例差距不显著;医保差异化报销制度的知晓度有待提高。(2)2018年家庭医生服务的各项签约率均达到预期目标。主要问题包括,总体签约率仅为40.95%,与普及家庭医生服务仍有距离;若普及家庭医生服务,团队数量存在短缺;居民对家庭医生服务的认知有待提高;部分签约居民对家庭医生服务的认可度不高;家庭医生对非重点人群的关注度不够。(3)2018年末宁夏已构建医联体71个,覆盖90%的基层医疗机构。医联体主要问题包括,均为松散型服务模式;医院对基层的帮扶形式和效果具有局限性。(4)互联网诊疗服务和远程诊断是基层互联网医疗的主要应用形式。主要问题包括,2018年互联网诊疗服务仅在部分基层医疗机构开展;基层互联网诊疗量占基层总诊疗量的比重仅为0.28%,居民未形成利用基层互联网诊疗服务的意识;基层互联网诊疗的服务过程相对繁琐和耗时。2.基层医疗服务能力的现状与地区特征(1)近年来,基层的医疗机构数、各类卫生人员、设备和床位、资产与收支均呈快速增长,但是按照卫生规划目标以及进一步患者下沉基层的就诊需求,部分医疗资源仍需优化配置。社区卫生服务中心和村卫生室数量仍需增加;基层医疗机构的基础设施建设达标率和医保定点机构比重仍具有提升空间。基层卫生人员仍然短缺;村医数满足需求但呈减少趋势;全科医生仍需继续增加;基层卫生技术人员的学历和职称有待提高,尤其是乡镇卫生院;基层医护人员工作量增加且收入偏低不利于基层形成职业吸引力。基层的设备配备水平有待改善,尤其是社区卫生服务机构;床位的数量和使用率均呈较低水平;基层可配备药品基本能够满足患者治疗需求。(2)从熵权资源分布指数来看,宁夏各地区存在基层医疗资源配置差异性,城市地区基层医疗资源配置水平相比农村较低(t=-2.265,P=0.035)。从资源集聚度来看,各地区各类基层医疗资源相对人口分布均处于不同程度的过剩、短缺或平衡状态,地区分布公平性欠佳。(3)近年来,宁夏基层诊疗量总体呈上升趋势,但基层诊疗率呈下降趋势,2018年基层诊疗率仅为43.63%,与70%的阶段目标仍有较大差距。社区诊疗量在基层总诊疗量中的比重最低,引导居民基层就诊城市应是重点。双向转诊率均处于较低水平,并形成相对的“上转容易、下转难”,加剧患者向上集中。(4)从基层诊疗服务的利用效率来看,宁夏仅有45.45%的地区实现了综合效率有效且规模报酬不变;对未达到综合效率有效的12个地区进行指标投影分析,这些地区均存在不同程度地资源投入相对过剩,应作为引导居民基层就诊重点区域,以实现投入与产出协同性。从空间均衡的角度,各地区基层人均诊疗量的全局Moran's I指数为0.2162(P<0.05),具有空间正相关性;空间滞后模型显示,其空间滞后因子系数为0.624(P<0.01),说明目标地区对邻近地区的诊疗服务利用具有正向带动影响;根据各地区所处空间分布格局,引导居民基层就诊可分别采取维持、鼓励、改革和帮扶四类区域策略。3.居民基层就诊选择的影响因素(1)经单因素检验,农村地区、45岁及以上、参加城乡居民医保、自评健康状况较好、体重正常或超重、病伤程度不严重的患者,认为就医机构距离近、技术水平不高、设备条件不好、候诊时间短、服务态度好、就诊花费不贵、总体满意、就诊自负费用不高的患者,建立健康档案、知道家庭医生和签约家庭医生的患者更倾向于选择基层医疗机构就诊。(2)根据随机效用模型,在其他因素保持平均水平的情况下,关于基层就诊选择概率,患者来自农村相比城市使之增加10.50%,患者健康状况一般相比很差使之增加9.79%,就医机构距离近使之增加14.28%,候诊时间短相比时间长使之增加22.67%,Ln(就诊自负费用)每降低一个单位使之增加7.69%,由于基层技术水平和设备条件的劣势,使之分别减少29.34%和38.40%,签约家庭医生相比未签约使之增加8.71%。基层医疗服务能力的改善应作为关键因素。4.引导居民基层就诊的仿真策略模拟实验(1)实施“普及家庭医生服务”、“提高基层技术水平”、“改善基层设备条件”三类引导居民基层就诊的仿真策略,均可不同程度地增加基层诊疗率、基层诊疗量、基层医师需求量,以及节约个人自负费用和医保支付费用。(2)实施“普及家庭医生服务”策略,2023年的基层诊疗率仅为46.73%,与分级诊疗阶段目标仍有较大差距,该策略对居民基层就诊引导效果相对有限,且不会出现基层医师供需缺口。(3)实施“提高基层技术水平”和“改善基层设备条件”两类策略,能够有效实现患者下沉基层,2023年的基层诊疗率将分别达到66.71%和75.49%,接近或超过分级诊疗阶段目标,但是基层可承接诊疗量的比重分别仅为79.71%和70.57%,医师缺口分别为1663人和2781人,基层医疗机构承接患者的能力有限。(4)按照假设的基层互联网诊疗率,实施互联网医疗对基层医师的补充力度非常有限。若要通过推广基层互联网医疗来弥补“提高基层技术水平”和“改善基层设备条件”两类策略所产生的基层医师供需缺口,2023年的基层互联网诊疗率需分别达到19.01%和28.15%。结论与建议1.主要结论(1)家庭医生签约率和基层互联网诊疗量有待提高,各项分级诊疗相关策略的制度或服务过程存在部分缺陷,还未充分发挥居民基层就诊的引导作用。(2)近年来各类基层医疗资源总体呈现快速增长,但是部分医疗资源的数量和质量仍需优化,同时基层医疗资源的地区分布公平性欠佳。(3)基层诊疗服务的绩效结果尚不理想,针对城市地区、未实现资源利用效率的地区、基层诊疗服务利用处于低-高格局的地区和处于低-低格局的核心地区,实施引导居民基层就诊的改革措施是更有效的。(4)签约家庭医生服务、改善基层医疗机构的技术水平和设备条件是提升居民基层就诊选择概率的关键因素。(5)相比普及家庭医生签约服务,提高基层技术水平和改善基层设备条件可有效引导患者下沉基层,但需面对医师缺口,基层的承接能力有限。2.对策建议(1)落实政府医改责任,完善各项制度与政策;(2)优化医疗资源配置,提高基层医疗服务提供能力;(3)均衡地区差异,提升基层诊疗服务的整体绩效;(4)改善基层的技术水平和设备条件,获取居民就诊信任;(5)普及家庭医生签约服务,培养居民基层就诊习惯;(6)推广基层互联网医疗,实现优质医疗资源纵向共享。"	2020-05-26	2020	09		10.27272/d.cnki.gshdu.2020.000008
CMFD2021	我国医联体式分级诊疗模式研究	陈锦华	上海海洋大学	上海海洋大学	分级诊疗;;医联体;;医疗资源	"随着我国社会经济发展,人民对健康的需求增长加快、要求不断丰富,如何统筹区域医疗资源,构建合理稳固就医格局,是我国现有医疗卫生服务体系面临的巨大挑战。2009年4月,我国颁布《中共中央国务院关于深化医药卫生体制改革的意见》[1],国家启动新一轮深化医药卫生体制改革(新医改),要求各层级医疗卫生单位积极推进以基层首诊和双向转诊为主要内容的分级诊疗工作。2010年原卫生部等五部委印发《关于公立医院改革试点的指导意见》,要求统筹协调各层级医疗机构医疗资源,推动实施分级诊疗。2012年,《卫生事业发展“十二五”规划》提出找准各层级医疗机构功能定位,推动二级以上医疗机构对基层医疗机构的技术和资源帮扶。2015年9月,国务院办公厅印发《关于推进分级诊疗制度建设的指导意见》,明确要求提升基层医疗服务能力,实施分级诊疗,建立符合国情的分级诊疗制度。建立并完善分级诊疗制度,有利于统筹医疗资源、提升基层诊疗能力、促进优质医疗资源的合理利用、规范就医格局。文章通过文献研究法,文章对目前国内外专家学者已开展对分级诊疗的研究进行综述,发现目前对分级诊疗的研究主要集中在内涵研究、国际经验研究、现状研究、问题与对策研究,以及实践评价研究等方面。本文以利益集团理论和资源整合理论为指导,通过实证研究法,总结W市实施分级诊疗主要措施有五项:一是提升基层医疗机构服务能力,二是强化医保政策的刚性引导,三是强化对分级诊疗宣传的柔性引导,四是规范分级诊疗制度,五是强化分级诊疗考核。文章通过对W市分级诊疗现状展开分析,发现W市分级诊疗存在基层医疗机构卫生技术人才短缺、医疗设备缺失、基层医院床位利用率低、双向转诊率下降、患者基层首诊率低、市级医院功能定位不精准等问题。文章采取问卷调查法,通过患者和医务人员对分级诊疗认知和满意度展开对W市分级诊疗效果分析发现,一是超过一半比例的患者对分级诊疗不知晓具体内容,医务人员绝大部分能够知晓分级诊疗内容;二是就诊等候时间长短、医疗设备配置是否齐全、是否能够及时判断病情、诊疗的延续性等是影响患者对分级诊疗满意度的主要原因;三是工作环境好坏、医疗设备配置是否齐全、医疗信息是否共享、收入水平高低等是影响医务人员对分级诊疗满意度的主要原因;四是导致基层医院难以吸收卫技人才的主要原因有收入水平低、工作环境差、职业发展困哪、学术科研机会少等;五是80%医务人员认为要发挥医联体统筹医疗资源的优势,加大对基层医院在人才培养、医疗设备、诊疗环境、技术指导等方面的投入。文章还通过文献研究法,总结借鉴以英国、日本、美国为代表的国外分级诊疗优势经验,对国内五大分级诊疗模式展开分析比较。文章得出W市医联体式分级诊疗目前存在五个方面的问题,一是分级诊疗宣传效果欠佳,二是基层首诊率低,三是基层医院医疗服务能力不足,四是市级医院功能定位不精准,五是双向转诊制度不够完善。针对目前W市医联体分级诊疗存在的问题,本文提出:要进一步加大宣传力度,提升群众知晓度;加大医疗设备投入,加强人才队伍建设,提高基层医院医疗服务能力水平;完善分级诊疗特别是双向转诊制度;打破固有利益关系,回归医院功能定位等,完善W市的分级诊疗模式。并从研究分级诊疗、医保支付、人才引进培养、临床管理、医疗教学、科研管理等六个方面规范内部运行机制。本文创新有三点:一是对国内外代表分级诊疗模式进行了比较分析;二是通过患者和医务人员对分级诊疗认知和满意度开展问卷调查,对W市分级诊疗效果展开分析研究;三是总结国内外分级诊疗模式优秀经验,创新构建W市分级诊疗模式,规范内部运行机制。本文弥补了对分级诊疗模式研究分析的空缺,对我国分级诊疗模式研究具有一定的实践指导意义和借鉴参考意义。"	2020-05-26	2020	02		10.27314/d.cnki.gsscu.2020.000137

CMFD2022	基于博弈模型的双向转诊驱动机制研究	张悦	上海交通大学	上海交通大学	医疗系统;;双向转诊;;驱动机制;;博弈模型	"为应对在分级诊疗体系下的资源紧缺和高低层医院利用率失衡等问题,我国政府提出了双向转诊等应对政策。然而转诊实际运作中,仍存在高低层医院利益目标不一致、上下转诊动力不足等问题。因此,本文针对下转和上转两类问题,分别研究其协调驱动机制。针对向下转诊问题,本文提出了基于收益共享的转诊驱动机制,建立三阶段决策的合作转诊序贯博弈模型。首先,高层级医院选择一家合适的低层级医院作为合作伙伴;其次,设计基于收益分享的转诊机制分析两家医院协调运作的条件与均衡策略。最后,通过案例研究和数值分析,讨论该机制下医院间的合伙策略对于效益、决策和患者等待时间的影响,从而促进康复(微病)下转的推广实施。针对向上转诊问题,本文提出了基于服务支付的转诊驱动机制,分别建立了非竞争型和竞争型的转诊序贯博弈模型。两模型首先分别研究了系统集中决策下的最优转诊阈值策略以及服务支付契约合作模式下的最优契约形式;接着,讨论了系统完美协调与非完美协调的存在性和协调条件;最后结合数值案例分析,研究了医疗规模大小、是否引入竞争等因素对于系统效益提升和协调效率的影响。本文得出如下主要结论。第一,高层级医院应在一定条件下采用最优合伙策略去匹配可供下转的低层级医院;第二,在极少不利合作的情形下,高层级医院可采取逆向补贴策略促成向下转诊的合作;第三,小规模竞争型比大规模非竞争型系统的协调效率高,故设计高效的上转系统建议考虑多家小型高层级-少数大型低层级医院的医联体。"	2020-05-01	2020	01		10.27307/d.cnki.gsjtu.2020.001985
CMFD2021	基于分级诊疗制度的A公司精准服务策略研究	杨永丰	河南工业大学	河南工业大学	分级诊疗;;A公司;;精准服务;;满意度	"随着分级诊疗制度的逐步实施和健康中国战略的推进,分级诊疗作为一个非常热门的话题在各级医疗机构之间被广泛讨论。分级诊疗是按照疾病的紧急程度以及治疗的复杂情况分级,让不同等级的医疗机构承担不同疾病的诊疗职能,争取做到“小病留社区,大病去医院,康复在社区”,以引导医疗机构之间相互促进、相互支撑,有效使用诊疗资源,并逐步达到全民基层首诊,双向转诊,上下联动,急慢分治的目的。尽管基层医院是分级诊疗的受益主体,由于诊疗能力尚未得到居民的深度认可,导致患者不愿意到基层医院进行康复治疗。当前对分级诊疗制度的研究还是侧重于理论研究和政策引导方面,尚未有切实可行的落地方案。因此,拿出一套行之有效的提升各级医疗机构的诊疗能力的精准服务方案是非常有必要的。本文以A公司为研究对象,对其在产品服务、技术服务、物流服务、培训体系等方面的现状进行分析,结合客户对A公司的服务满意度调查和整理,找到A公司在服务过程中的具体问题:产品体系不够健全,产品规格方面不能充分满足不同用量级别客户的需求,产品先进性和引领性方面不能满足三级医院的需求;技术服务方面,由于没有精准的分级,导致技术服务的质量没有达到预期;由于物流体系的不完善,导致偏远地区的物流质量没有达到预期,在紧急情况下物流不能满足客户的需求等。结合不同医疗机构在不同发展阶段的具体需求,构建了A公司具有先进性和引领性的产品体系,更加符合市场规律与不同产品生命周期的价格体系,具有常规服务、质量服务和赋能服务等完善的技术服务体系,搭建了常规物流和应急物流相结合、补充的物流体系,以及客户培训平台与精准培训内容相结合的精准化培训体系,为A公司精准服务客户提供借鉴。"	2020-05-01	2020	01		10.27791/d.cnki.ghegy.2020.000011
CMFD2021	公共政策视野下社区家庭医生制度研究	尹科	华北水利水电大学	华北水利水电大学	社区家庭医生制度;;分级诊疗;;公共政策	"近年来,我国医疗卫生需求日益增长,社会人口老龄化,医疗资源分配不均,医患关系紧张,老百姓觉得“大医院看不起,小医院治不好”等问题日渐明显。为了解决这些问题,做好广大百姓的健康保障,我国在新一轮医疗改革中,把以分级诊疗为目的的社区家庭医生制度作为新一轮医改的重要举措。社区家庭医生制度是近几年被重点推广的一项国家公共政策之一。社区家庭医生制度具体是指通过和社区居民签约的形式,以家庭医生团队为服务主体,为签约居民提供合理、长期、连续、优质的医疗服务。该项政策在经历了上海、广州、杭州等试点城市的推广摸索阶段之后,在2016年社区家庭医生制度在全国范围内全面展开。通过社区家庭医生制度的逐渐推行,老龄人群健康及慢性病管理已经获得成效,初步缓解了医患矛盾,优化了医疗环境,为分级诊疗夯实了基础。在面对重大疾病疫情时,通过社区家庭医生合理分诊、分流患者的就医模式,高效合理地分配了医疗资源,充分体现出社区家庭医生制度的科学性和重要性。社区家庭医生制度是目前我国最科学有效的一项医改制度。本文以河南省南阳市卧龙区为研究对象,通过问卷调查和访谈方法,对南阳市卧龙区社区家庭医生制度做调查研究。作者通过研究得出:社区家庭医生制度在本区已经全面实施,本区居民对社区家庭医生制度已经有了一定程度的认可,社区家庭医生制度团队建设也初见成效;目前南阳市卧龙区已经完成22.5万签约居民,建立家庭医生团队184个,23个社区医疗服务中心,特殊贫困户家庭医生签约率92%,在高血压、糖尿病等慢性病管理方面受到辖区居民满意评价;通过社区家庭医生制度的实施,本区的就医流程得到优化,有效缓解了医患关系,合理分配了医疗资源,分级诊疗初见成效。作者通过研究发现本区依然存在如下不足:社区家庭医生制度宣传不到位,居民对家庭医生制度认知有偏差,家庭医生签约困难;家庭医生人才短缺,家庭医生社会地位与收入与实际工作不匹配;居民签约家庭医生后没有实现家庭医生首诊制,家庭医生政策执行过程中没有实现双向转诊,最终没有实现全面分级诊疗。针对这些问题,通过定量定性分析研究,借鉴国内部分城市和国外社区家庭医生制度经验,结合公共政策理论,做出以下建议:(一)社区家庭医生制度是世界公认的科学合理的就医模式,完善家庭医生制度是实现政策效果的必备条件。(二)提高家庭医生服务签约率,让广大居民享受到政策的实惠,更有利于政策的长治有效推广。(三)持续推进分级诊疗,强化新医改的政策目的。(四)通过人性化签约方式和建立示范社区等注重政策执行细节。"	2020-05-01	2020	01		10.27144/d.cnki.ghbsc.2020.000522

CMFD2022	医联体环境下医疗资源共享的现状及对策研究	何键	新疆农业大学	新疆农业大学	医疗资源共享;;医联体;;重庆市潼南区人民医院	"长期以来,我国的医疗资源总量短缺,且配置很不合理,供给不足与闲置浪费并存,建立分级诊疗制度势在必行。医联体作为构建分级诊疗的主要抓手,对医联体内部医疗资源共享举措、成效、问题及影响因素进行及时总结评估,对于后续医联体建设、分级诊疗落实有着极为重要的意义。本研究总结了国内外医疗联合体医疗资源整合共享经验,并选择重庆市潼南区人民医院医联体作为研究对象,采用问卷调查的方式对医联体内资源共享现状与成效、医务人员、患者对医联体的知晓情况以及满意度进行研究。本研究共发放问卷412份,回收有效问卷401份,回收率97.33%。问卷结果显示,潼南区人民医院医联体在资源共享方面推出了较多举措,但在人力、物力、财力、技术和信息资源共享方面都存在量和深度的不足,医联体内部诊疗人次和双向转诊人次增加,医联体医务人员和患者满意度相对较高,但下转人次较少,次均费用略有上涨,患者对医联体知晓率相对较低,医联体医疗资源共享成效不显著。产生这些问题的原因主要包括:人力资源总量不足、激励补偿机制不够、资金池使用机制尚未完善、高端医疗设备较少、分院技术开展受限和医院之间存在信息孤岛等。以此为依据提出对策建议:落实潼南区医联体建设方案、争取政府相关部门大力支持;加大人才引进力度、创新人才培养机制;细化激励考核制度、完善资金池使用机制;加强八大中心建设、加快医疗设备购置;加强业务培训,实现检验检查结果互认等。本研究对相关的同类研究和实践具有一定的借鉴和参考意义。"	2020-04-01	2020	09		10.27431/d.cnki.gxnyu.2020.000147
CMFD2022	医疗联合体双向转诊决策研究	戈宏辉	东南大学	东南大学	医疗联合体;;双向转诊;;收益共享契约;;转诊报酬	"一直以来,我国存在着三级医院人满为患,而社区医院医疗资源闲置的情况。即使为了简单或基础医疗服务,我国很多患者也倾向于去三级医院就诊,以获得优质的医疗服务。这种情况导致了严重的社会问题,医疗资源的不平衡使医疗服务的效率大打折扣。因此政府着手开展医疗联合体建设,促使优质医疗资源纵向下沉,解决大医院看病难等问题,推动形成基层首诊、双向转诊的分级诊疗模式,实现患者合理分流。医联体的建设至今颇有成效,但是在实施层面上依然存在的阻碍和挑战,特别是松散型医联体,主要问题在于收益分配机制不清晰和基层医疗服务能力较低。基于此,本文以三级医院和社区医院组成的两级医疗服务系统为研究对象,刻画医联体内医院之间双向转诊的流程,基于报童模型建立双向转诊的数学模型,并根据卫健委公布的医疗数据,对函数进行数值仿真分析。首先对紧密型医联体即集中式决策下的情形进行分析,寻求系统最优下转率。研究结果表明:(1)紧密型医联体内,当三级医院的初诊患者数量确定时,存在最优下转率使得系统期望收益最大化;当三级医院的初诊患者数量不确定时,只有当下转率满足一定条件时系统期望收益函数才存在最大值。(2)紧密型医联体内,无论三级医院的患者数量是否确定,社区医院的轻度患者比例和三级医院的轻度患者比例减小时,重度患者数量增加,系统的期望收益增加。随后,对松散型医联体即分散式决策下的情形进行分析。引入转诊报酬方案,探究其是否可以实现松散型医联体内部医疗服务系统的协调。研究结果表明:(1)松散型医联体内,转诊报酬方案无法实现两级医疗服务系统的协调,但是转诊报酬可以增加三级医院和系统的期望收益,同时提高三级医院下转率。虽然存在最优的转诊报酬方案使得社区医院的收益最大化,实现三级医院、社区医院和松散型医联体的三赢,但是该社区医院最优转诊报酬的数值很小。(2)三级医院的可用资源数量越多,三级医院的最优收益越大;但反直觉地,三级医院的可用资源数量越少,医联体的最优收益越大。原因在于,三级医院的可用资源数量多时,其最优下转率相对较小则资源闲置成本较小,所以此时三级医院的最优收益相对较高;三级医院的可用资源数量少时,系统的最优下转率相对较大,同样导致资源闲置成本较小,所以此时医疗服务系统的最优收益相对较高。这解释了实际中松散型医联体内的三级医院不愿过多下转患者的情况,下转患者数量过多将导致资源闲置成本升高而降低三级医院的期望收益。"	2020-04-01	2020	03		10.27014/d.cnki.gdnau.2020.003495

CMFD2022	基于修正Shapley值法的我国紧密型医联体内成员利益分配研究	朱江汉	湖北大学	湖北大学	医联体;;利益分配;;Shapley值法;;核心医院	"医联体是实施分级诊疗制度的重要载体,国家从2009年至今,多次下发文件提出要加快推进医联体建设。当前医联体建设亟需解决的问题是构建医联体成员利益分配机制。我国医联体的发展大致经过了萌芽阶段(20世纪80年代至90年代中期)、探索阶段(20世纪90年代中期至2009年)、正式试点阶段(2009年至2017年)、全面推进阶段(2017年至今)四个阶段。目前,我国医联体按照各成员之间紧密程度可以划分为紧密型医联体、半紧密型医联体和松散型医联体三大类,其中紧密型医联体因实现了人、财、物各方面的高度整合,在三类医联体中效果最好,松散型医联体由于整合资源较少,建立难度相对较小,所以我国多数医联体选择组件类型时倾向于松散型。在对我国医联体利益分配现状与存在问题分析时,本文将医联体的利益相关者按照层级划分为政府机构、医疗机构和个体,政府机构中主要是各级卫生健康委员会、财政以及医保等与医联体利益联系紧密的部门。医疗机构主要包括核心医院和其他参建医疗机构,这是医联体核心利益相关者。我国医联体利益分配现状和问题主要表现在:1.财政和医保未将医联体视为一个联盟进行政府统一支付,使医联体成员区块化;2.各成员单位尤其是核心医院和基层医疗机构博弈激烈;3.政府部门对医联体的利益调节不到位,医疗体尚未建立明确的利益分配机制。在算例研究部分,本文选取Shapley值法模型用于构建医联体利益分配模型。在指标选取上,结合文献材料和专家意见将修正Shapley值法模型的指标确定为各成员投入、上下转诊量、管理成本三个方面,利用层次分析法(AHP)对指标权重进行测算,修正经典Shapley值模型。通过对比修正前后Shapley值模型计算结果发现:修正后核心医院利益分配比例上升,二级医院和基层医疗机构利益分配比例下降,且基层医疗机构利益分配比例下降幅度较大。针对该结果,本文提出,需要保证基层医疗机构的合理收入,核心医院的投入成本不应转嫁到基层医疗机构和二级医院,政府应对此给予补助,确保各成员有较高的积极性,从而使医联体持续、健康发展,实现强基层的目标。"	2020-03-20	2020	05		10.27130/d.cnki.ghubu.2020.000303

CDFD2022	医疗信息水平对医院满意度和收支水平的影响机制研究	宋平	西南财经大学	西南财经大学	医疗信息水平;;分级诊疗;;高层管理支持;;满意度;;收入成本率	"2016年8月19日,我国召开了进入本世纪以来规格最高的“卫生与健康大会”,将分级诊疗制度作为5项基本医疗卫生制度之首,推动我国逐步形成“基层首诊、双向转诊、急慢分治、上下联动”的就医模式。分级诊疗的提出,是基于我国选择性“看病难、看病贵”的历史背景,借鉴国外家庭医生制度,我国提出的一项卫生改革重大策略。为推动分级诊疗创造更好的运行环境,很多学者研究了分级诊疗的驱动因素,如医疗信息化建设、医疗保险水平等,但是这些研究大多基于现象观察和结果判断进行开展,缺乏从信息资源禀赋和资源依赖的角度,运用实证分析方法,系统地探讨信息化水平在分级诊疗实施过程中的作用机理。同时,随着老百姓对公立医疗机构社会属性认识理解的深入,医疗机构满意度的问题逐渐成为行业研究的热点。从利益相关者理论的角度,分级诊疗的实施对医院满意度的影响如何,在学界争论较大,也限于这项制度在我国实施的时限较短,尚缺少较为系统全面的实证研究来探讨分级诊疗对满意度的影响。另外,作为公立医疗机构,保持公益性是其合理运营的基石,实施分级诊疗,让原本上行的患者就医流向逐渐回头,并转向下行,这为增加县域内各级医疗机构的业务收入提供了机遇。因此,本研究基于资源基础理论、资源依赖理论和利益相关者理论,从信息化水平与分级诊疗的深层次关系为切入点,探讨分级诊疗与医院满意度和收入成本率的关系。另外,不管是推进分级诊疗,还是提升医院信息化水平,还是提高医院满意度和合理控制医院收支结构的平衡,医院高层管理人员是主要的利益相关者,其态度支持与否至关重要。医疗机构要实现分级诊疗,尤其是县域内的公立医疗机构,本身在发展中就滞后于大型的三级医院,管理水平参差不齐,要让高层管理团队形成改革发展的共识,落实好县域内分级诊疗的目标,还存在的不少不确定因素。本研究的内容模块由如下四个部分组成:第一部分,绪论,为本文的第一章。内容主要包括研究背景、意义和目标,对研究方案以及技术路线的说明,介绍研究的特色及创新,最后是概述本研究的章节结构情况。第二部分,构建理论框架及提出研究假设,由本文的第二章和第三章组成。内容主要包括理论基础、文献综述、模型构建和研究假设。第三部分,实证研究,由本文的第四章、第五章构成。内容主要包括实证研究设计、数据分析和假设检验。第四部分,结论、建议与展望,为本文的第六章。内容主要包括研究结论、政策建议、研究不足和研究展望。本研究基于资源基础理论、资源依赖理论和利益相关者理论,构建了“医疗信息水平――分级诊疗――医院满意度(即医务人员满意度和患者满意度)――收入成本率”的模型框架,进而探索了分级诊疗实施程度和医院满意度在其中的中介作用,以及高层管理支持的调节作用。四川省在2014年10月全域实施分级诊疗,是全国第一个推行分级诊疗的人口大省。本研究以四川省87个县(市、区)的公立医疗机构(包括县级公立医院、基层医疗卫生机构)为研究对象,收集整理了这些县(市、区)在医疗信息、分级诊疗、医院满意度和收入支出等方面的客观数据,并对每个县域的高层卫生管理者进行了问卷调查,进而对提出的理论模型进行了实证检验。首先,本研究对相关变量进行概念界定,提炼医疗信息水平和分级诊疗的测量维度,确定了医院满意度和收入成本率的衡量范畴,结合专家访谈和实地调研对调查问卷进行修改。其次,通过精心梳理卫生行政部门大量相关数据,本研究对87个县(市、区)公立医疗机构的医疗信息水平、分级诊疗、医院满意度和收入成本率进行测量。然后,对这87个县(市、区)的601位高层管理者进行了问卷调查,回收有效样本422份,问卷有效率为70.21%。再次,本研究对数据进行整合匹配,对样本数据结构的有效性进行了分析,即利用统计软件SPSS22.0进行了信度分析、聚合检验和描述性统计分析,采用Smart PLS3.0统计分析软件,通过验证性因子分析,分别检验自变量的因子载荷系数(loading)及中介变量的因子权重系数(weight),并对研究中提出的假设进行逐一验证。该部分使用Smart PLS3.0统计分析软件进行了假设检验,包括主效应、中介效应、调节效应的检验。最后,本研究对实证结果进行了分析讨论。本研究把定性分析与定量分析有机结合,探讨了医改背景下,医疗信息水平对县域内分级诊疗的作用机制,以及分级诊疗对医院满意度和收入成本率的影响,本研究的特色和创新主要表现在以下四方面。第一,从研究的理论来看,本研究基于资源基础理论和资源依赖理论,将医疗信息水平与分级诊疗进行关联,进一步探讨其对医院满意度和收入成本率的影响,构建了“医疗信息水平――分级诊疗――医院满意度(即医务人员满意度和患者满意度)――收入成本率”的模型框架。当前基于资源基础理论和资源依赖理论的应用研究,主要是从组织层面探讨企业的经营发展和绩效提升,少有研究从相对宏观层面将这两个理论进行结合。本研究从区域发展的角度,以医疗服务行业为场景,将县域层面的医疗卫生机构作为研究对象,从信息化水平与分级诊疗的深层次关系为切入点,探讨分级诊疗与医院满意度和收入成本率的关系,拓宽了资源基础理论和资源依赖理论的情景边界。第二,从研究的内容来看,本研究以县域医疗卫生机构为研究对象,且县域样本数量达到87个,探索和分析了分级诊疗的前因影响因素及其影响结果。目前,对于分级诊疗的研究主要是从定性角度讨论阻碍该政策实施的障碍和困难,仍缺乏一致的观点和结论,并且从实证角度缺乏量化研究,尤其是在我国特殊的就医习惯背景下,实施分级诊疗的实证研究更为缺乏。本研究以分级诊疗和医院满意度为中介变量,揭示了医疗信息水平到收入成本率的内在作用机制,拓展了分级诊疗的前因后果的研究内容,洞悉了医疗信息水平到收入成本率的传导机制。此外,本研究还探究了高层管理支持的边界条件,证实了高层管理支持在医疗信息水平和分级诊疗实施程度之间存在着调节作用,进而从高层管理团队层面验证了提升高层管理支持对推动分级诊疗实施和提升医疗信息水平的重要性。第三,从研究的方法来看,多渠道的数据来源保证了本研究数据的真实和可靠性,跨时段研究设计有利于对变量前因后果关系的检验。本研究采用纵向时序调查,前因变量时限在前,其余变量的时限在后,这有利于对变量的前因后果关系进行检验,并且在一定程度上减少了共同方法偏差,能够更为真实地体现各变量之间的内在联系。另外,本研究的数据来源于数字化医院等级评审、卫生信息统计平台、国家医院满意度综合调查和直接问卷调查4个完全不同的渠道,避免了变量之间可能产生的共同方法偏差。同时,本研究采用数据统计分析软件,使用SPSS 22.0进行信度分析、聚合检验和描述性分析,基于Smart PLS3.0统计分析软件进行假设检验,以科学严谨的方式进行数据处理和模型验证。通过这些研究的设计和方法切实有效的提升了数据的质量和检验的效果。第四,从变量的测量来看,开拓性地探索了分级诊疗这一构念。以往关于分级诊疗的研究,主要聚焦于对分级诊疗政策的分析,以及其实施的利弊和存在的阻力等,鲜有研究针对分级诊疗开展实证探索,且并没有对分级诊疗这一构念进行量化探索。本研究开拓性地从理论和实践的角度提出了分级诊疗的测量维度,分别是县域内就诊率和基层医疗卫生机构诊疗量占比。在做出先驱性探索的同时,为未来分级诊疗相关的实证研究提供了方法和思路。本研究探讨了“医疗信息水平――分级诊疗――医院满意度(即医务人员满意度和患者满意度)――收入成本率”的影响路径,并提出高层管理支持的调节作用,通过实证分析验证了有关假设。虽然在研究过程中尽量遵循严谨的科学研究范式,也尽量贴合所选取的理论内涵,但由于作者资源和学术能力的有限性,造成本研究存在无力避免的不足之处,主要体现在样本的有限性、研究结构层次的局限以及相关构念的进一步探讨等方面。因此,希望在未来的研究中,学者们需要以更加全面的研究形式和内容来更深入地对分级诊疗实施程度开展前因后果的研究。"	2020-03-01	2020	02		10.27412/d.cnki.gxncu.2020.000276

CMFD2021	云南省居民就医行为影响因素研究	龚钰雯	昆明理工大学	昆明理工大学	就医行为;;安德森卫生服务利用模型;;顾客满意度;;分级诊疗	"随着人民生活水平的不断提高,对于健康的需求也随之上升,人民对医疗卫生服务的质量和服务连续性等方面的要求也日益增长。由于我国医疗卫生资源存在分布不合理等问题,居民就医选择倾向于医院,于是造成医院“人满为患”的现状,并加剧了医患矛盾。因此,分级诊疗制度的建立和落实有利于扭转医疗卫生资源分布不合理的格局,合理分流患者,增加基层医疗卫生机构的就诊率,促进合理有序的就医秩序的形成,缓解相对紧张的医患关系。近年来,云南省为了满足居民的医疗卫生服务需求,积极推行分级诊疗政策、构建有序合理的就医秩序,但从整体来看,实施效果未能达到预期,居民就医仍然倾向于医院,基层医疗卫生机构“门可罗雀”的状况并未得到改善,“看病难”的问题也并没有得到解决。因此,本文通过分析云南省居民就医行为影响因素,找到当前阻碍云南省分级诊疗实施的原因,并提出可行的对策和建议。本研究主要基于安德森卫生服务利用模型、效用理论与消费者选择以及顾客满意度理论构建理论框架,采用多项Logit回归分析以及结构方程等方法对云南省居民就医行为的影响因素进行研究,发现:(1)医疗卫生服务体系影响居民就医行为;(2)个体特征因素是影响居民选择的重要因素;(3)基层医疗卫生机构提供服务的能力对基层首诊影响较大;(4)医疗费用低、就医距离近是吸引居民基层就医的有效手段。为此,提出以下政策建议:(1)提高基层医疗卫生机构的服务能力;(2)完善基本药物制度;(3)加强基层医疗卫生机构的优势发展;(4)引导居民合理有序就医。"	2020-03-01	2020	05		10.27200/d.cnki.gkmlu.2020.000729
CMFD2021	我国分级诊疗政策扩散过程现实困境及对策研究	杜红妹	天津财经大学	天津财经大学	政策扩散;;基层医疗卫生服务;;基层首诊;;双向转诊;;分级诊疗	"随着我国经济不断发展,人们对公共医疗卫生领域的服务质量要求越来越高,尤其是随着公共医疗卫生服务改革不断深化,构建一个新型医疗卫生服务体系备受关注。为了不断满足人们对公共医疗卫生服务的需求、解决资源配置不合理的问题,我国提出了分级诊疗政策,分级诊疗政策提出目的主要是为了提高医疗卫生服务质量,缓解就医难的问题。近年来,我国的分级诊疗政策实践取得了一定成果,并且基层医疗服务能力稳步提升、基层首诊、双向转诊势头良好、人才流动更加活跃,但在该政策扩散过程中仍面临着很多问题,分级诊疗政策顺利扩散任重而道远。本研究在梳理分级诊疗政策扩散过程中发现当前该政策扩散面临三重困境:基层医疗卫生体制薄弱、双向转诊和基层首诊有待完善以及政策扩散主体间利益存在主要矛盾的困境。分析其原因主要有:基层医疗资源缺乏导致医疗体制薄弱、传统就医观念及政策工具单一导致转诊和首诊困难、目标偏差导致政策扩散主体利益矛盾。针对分级诊疗政策扩散过程面临的三重困境,有效借鉴国外分级诊疗政策扩散实践经验,总结出以下优化路径:首先,基层医疗卫生服务应该建立完善基层卫生服务体制,拓宽基层全科医生建设、灵活分配收入,增强基层全科医生热情、改革基层医疗卫生管理机制;其次,要健全保障措施促进分级诊疗政策顺利扩散,制定完善的转诊标准、运用多种政策工具提高基层首诊率、构建医疗服务信息共享平台;最后,各地方政府应不断平衡各方利益、加强各级医疗卫生机构间的双向沟通,协调双方利益、实现自利需求与公益需求间的平衡、实现群众对医疗服务需求与基层医疗服务供给之间的平衡。"	2020-03-01	2020	06		10.27354/d.cnki.gtcjy.2020.000282
CMFD2021	天津市分级诊疗制度实施障碍与对策研究	裴晶	天津财经大学	天津财经大学	分级诊疗;;基层医疗机构服务能力;;双向转诊标准;;医联体建设	"国务院于2015年颁布《关于推进分级诊疗制度建设的指导意见》,自此,分级诊疗制度在我国逐步推广建立。分级诊疗制度是缓解群众看病贵、看病难问题的有效手段,是以人民健康为中心的重要体现,是促进健康中国战略实施的一项重要举措。国家高度重视分级诊疗制度的实践探索,天津市也在采取各种措施和方式推进分级诊疗工作,且取得了一定成绩。本文通过文献分析法梳理和分析天津市分级诊疗政策及组织保障情况,通过卫生费用情况、医疗卫生机构和医疗人员配置情况等对天津市医疗卫生资源配置的变化趋势及现状进行描述和分析;从医院与基层医疗机构服务提供情况、家庭医生签约服务、医联体建设等方面探讨天津市分级诊疗工作的主要实践,运用问卷调查法了解天津市居民对于分级诊疗制度的认知及满意度情况,分析出目前天津市分级诊疗工作取得一定成效但仍存在一些问题。由于基层医疗机构服务能力不足和医保政策作用不明显,导致基层首诊率低;由于转诊标准不明确导致双向转诊不畅通,由于不同层级医疗机构之间存在利益冲突导致医联体作用发挥有限。基于此,本文提出以下建议:一是增加基层医疗机构眼科、口腔科、皮肤科等的科室建设,满足人们的基本医疗需求;二是拉大各级医疗机构的医保报销比例,引导居民基层首诊;三是天津市政府要连同卫生职能部门及医疗机构共同制定明确具体的双向转诊标准和操作流程,促进双向转诊的规范化发展;四是逐渐取消大医院的常见病及多发病的门诊服务,同时改革医联体内的人事管理制度,促进医联体良性运作。通过这些对策建议助力推进天津市分级诊疗工作的实施。"	2020-03-01	2020	07		10.27354/d.cnki.gtcjy.2020.000999
CMFD2021	基于协同治理理论的医联体内双向转诊的实证研究	高玉娇	南京医科大学	南京医科大学	医联体;;双向转诊;;协同治理;;认知调查	"目的:本研究以协同治理理论为指导,通过对医患双方对医联体内双向转诊实施情况、认知情况和满意度情况进行调查,总结分析医联体内双向转诊制度实施过程中存在的问题及原因,运用协同治理理论构建对策体系,从多元主体提出推进双向转诊的政策建议,对促进该医联体内部实现有效双向转诊的机制建设起到重要推动作用,对医联体的建设、实现分级诊疗提供参考借鉴。对象与方法:调查该医联体内不同级别医疗机构患者和医务人员共计690人,有效回收问卷631份,有效回收率91.4%。共发放医务人员问卷250份,有效回收232份,其中三级医院医师106名,二级医院医师35名,一级及以下医院医师91名;共发放患者问卷440份,有效回收399份,调查对象涵盖了不同区域不同层次医疗机构人员。同时对医院管理人员进行深度访谈。本研究主要采用文献分析法、问卷调查法、访谈调查法以及统计分析法等调查方法。研究结果:(1)运行情况:该医联体双向转诊实施情况较差,仅实现双向转诊1445人次。(2)人口学特征:不同级别医疗机构医师在性别上无显著性差异(P>0.05),但在年龄、学历、工作年限、职称等方面均有显著差异(P<0.05)。(3)对双向转诊认知情况:医务人员较患者更了解双向转诊(P0.05),年龄、学历、职业、月收入、医保类型以及健康状况(p0.05)对双向转诊制度知晓度无影响,年龄、职称和工作年限(p0.05),医务人员对双向转诊便捷度评价以及满意度远低于患者。缺乏监督考核机制(70.7%)、医保未发挥作用(68.1%)以及缺乏明确的双向转诊制度和标准(66.4%)是影响满意度的主要因素。(5)双向转诊影响因素:病人自主要求(62.7%)、无法确诊(56.8%)和治疗条件差(42.7%)是医务人员认为影响上转的主要因素;家庭经济困难(68.1%)、照护不方便(64.2%)以及就诊流程繁琐(36.2%)则是患者认为的主要影响因素。医务人员(60.0%)和患者(68.1%)均认为基层医疗技术水平有限是影响下转的主要因素。(6)促进双向转诊措施:医务人员认为政府指导(86.6%)、医保引导(85.6%)、建立区域性分级诊疗体系(82.9%)以及提高基层卫生服务能力(79.7%)是推动双向转诊的重要推动举措。患者认为加大基层医疗投入(92.8%)、发挥医保引导作用(85.5%)、政府政策指导(84.1%)、建立区域性分级诊疗体系(76.8%)、明确转诊标准(72.5%)、改变就医观念(53.6%)对推动双向转诊有重要作用。研究结论:实现有效双向转诊的协同治理机制有待完善,政府、医疗机构、患者、第三部门的职能定位尚未明确。具体表现为:(1)起始条件:双向转诊推进困难。(2)催化领导:多元主体作用发挥不明显。(3)制度设计:制度仍需不断完善。(4)协同过程:治理主体之间缺乏联动。(5)协同效果:松散型医联体内双向转诊实施情况较差。政策建议:(1)政府部门要充分发挥引导作用。(2)医联体要发挥主体作用。(3)患者要改变原有的就医观念和习惯。(4)第三部门要积极发挥监管作用。"	2020-03-01	2020	07		10.27249/d.cnki.gnjyu.2020.000344

CDFD2023	中国分级诊疗制度实施效果研究	徐英奇	上海财经大学	上海财经大学	分级诊疗;;基层首诊;;健康;;家庭医疗经济负担;;效果	"我国卫生资源稀缺且配置低效,催生了“看病难、看病贵”这一长期困扰我国的重要民生问题,尤其小病大治、重复治疗、因病致贫、因病返贫等问题又进一步加重了解决的难度。国家从各个层面积极谋求破解之道,其中分级诊疗作为一种组织协调机制,可在深层次上解决现存的医疗资源配置和效率问题,《国务院办公厅关于推进分级诊疗制度建设的指导意见》(下称《意见》)中明确提出建立分级诊疗制度是合理配置医疗资源、促进基本医疗卫生服务均等化的重要举措,对提高人民健康水平具有重要意义,被认为是提高居民健康水平、解决“看病贵、看病难”的关键。然而分级诊疗作为国家推行的一项重要制度安排,关于分级诊疗实施效果的研究主要聚焦在地方案例研究和数学描述统计,缺少使用全国性微观数据库作为分析样本的研究。研究以经典理论为基础构建实证模型,运用大型微观数据库(CFPS),根据卫生经济学效果研究范畴,结合《意见》中分级诊疗制度的建设目的,重点分析分级诊疗对健康和家庭医疗经济负担两方面的影响,并实地调研东部发达省份和西部欠发达省份分级诊疗实施情况,结合国外经验提出政策建议。主要研究内容如下:第一,分级诊疗制度改善居民健康的效果研究。健康是医疗服务需求的最初动因,也是分级诊疗制度实行的根本目的,本研究在Grossman健康需求理论基础之上,构建分级诊疗与健康之间的分析模型,实证分析分级诊疗制度对居民健康水平的影响,重点关注了居民的自评健康、慢病健康和精神健康。第二,分级诊疗制度降低家庭医疗经济负担的效果研究。分级诊疗制度作为新医改中的重要组成部分,是解决“看病贵”问题的一剂良方。家庭医疗经济负担是居民自付医疗费用占家庭可支配收入或支出的比重,研究借助Andersen医疗服务利用模型,构建分级诊疗与家庭医疗经济负担之间的函数关系,通过两部模型法和工具变量法,研究基层首诊等分级诊疗因素对家庭医疗经济负担的影响。第三,分级诊疗制度典型地区案例研究。选取具有鲜明特征且具有学术意义的地区进行深入研究,对于整个分级诊疗制度效果研究是非常必要的。选取东部发达地区与西部欠发达地区作为案例对象,采取实地调研方式,获取第一手的信息数据,通过定量研究和定性分析,总结调研地区分级诊疗实施效果,为其他城市提供经验借鉴。第四,分级诊疗制度国际经验研究。我国分级诊疗制度起步晚,仍处于探索发展期,而国外一些发达国家已经形成了相对成熟的分级诊疗体系。中国有特殊的国情,需要制定符合中国实际的分级诊疗制度。选取国际上的典型国家如英国、德国和美国,围绕基层首诊、双向转诊和家庭医生三项内容,研究分级诊疗的实施经验,总结先进做法和成功要素。主要研究结论如下:第一,基层首诊显著提升居民健康水平,尤其对于精神健康和慢性病患者的健康具有改善作用。居民选择基层首诊能够10.1%提升居民自评健康水平,基层首诊提升居民精神健康和慢病健康的程度分别是11.3%和3.69%。基层首诊通过健康守门人制度,让家庭医生根据健康管理档案,及时对慢性病和精神疾病的人群健康干预,减少疾病发生概率,降低病情恶化风险。第二,基层首诊大幅降低家庭医疗经济负担。基层首诊是分级诊疗最主要的代表变量,本研究运用工具变量模型实证分析显示,选择基层首诊能大幅降低居民医疗经济负担,基层首诊引流居民到基层医疗卫生机构进行诊疗,基层医疗卫生机构相对收费低廉且免去其他交通等不必要的成本支出,能够降低居民医疗经济负担。第三,分级诊疗对弱势地区或弱势群体的健康改善作用更强。在城乡子样本分析中,基层首诊对农村居民的健康促进作用尤为明显,农村11.3%高于城市9.19%,医疗水平改善居民健康水平的程度也是乡村2.87%高于城市1.14%;在东中西部子样本分析中,到诊时间和医疗水平对健康的改善作用表现出中西部强于东部;在收入分层子样本分析中,低收入人群基层首诊10.8%高于中等基层9.62%和高收入人群6.39%,低收入群体在就诊意愿、医疗水平、对医生的信任度都表现出较强的敏感性。第四,家庭医生在健康管理和转诊服务作用明显。家庭医生是分级诊疗制度的重要内容,通过健康管理和上下转诊为居民提供健康保障,并降低家庭医疗经济负担。通过实证研究,家庭医生的信任程度和满意度都与健康正相关,在异质性分析中也同样具有很显著的影响。调研地区居民对家庭医生制度的认知度和签约率都较高,被调研对象对为自己提供诊疗服务的医生的信任程度平均得分为3.89分(满分5分),对家庭医生在健康管理和转诊服务的满意度较高。第五,医疗保险报销比例对家庭医疗经济负担有显著负向影响。从国外的经验来看,强制首诊的实现方式主要是通过医保报销来控制,双向转诊的对象选择也是通过费用额度来进行指引的。不同病患的报销结果影响家庭医疗经济负担程度显著不同,半年内有慢性病的居民是没有慢性病患者的2.0倍,一年内有住院经历的居民是没有住院经历的5.5倍,反映出居民在患病之后对于报销比例的高度敏感性。患慢性病和有住院经历的居民其发生的医疗费用一般较高,对于报销比例提高能够明显地影响其就诊选择。主要对策建议如下:第一,适度提高基层卫技人员诊疗水平。基层医疗卫生机构的软实力对于提升分级诊疗效果显著,基于分工定位应适当提升基层医疗卫生机构卫技人员诊疗水平,基层医疗卫生机构的服务能力要与其功能定位相匹配,而非越高越好。一方面,通过加大国家政策倾斜力度,鼓励院校开设全科医生专业,从根源上提高医生水平;另一方面,发展纵向医联体,鼓励高水平医生下沉到基层,通过传帮带手段促进医生资源双向流动,增强诊疗能力和诊疗水平,使其能够匹配起基础医疗、预防、保健、康复与健康教育等基本医疗卫生服务功能,担负起居民健康保护的第一层防线责任。第二,建立分级诊疗与健康扶贫长效机制。首先,建立新型医联体,将优质综合性医疗机构对接区域内的贫困地区基层医疗卫生机构,形成区域中心医院帮扶县医院、县医院帮扶乡镇卫生院的帮扶格局;其次,推动贫困人口“一对一”家庭签约服务,针对经济弱势群体实现家庭医生签约全覆盖,且每一个贫困家庭都有一个由乡村两级医疗卫生人员组成的专项服务团队对接;最后,对于中西部地区、农村地区以及一些低收入群体,在费用支付上,要考虑降低医疗费用,不设起付线,合理调整医疗保险支付保险比例或个人支付的上限。第三,用市场机制扩充家庭医生队伍。首先,引入私人医生加入家庭医生队伍,支持具备全科医师资质的执业医生开办全科诊所,并实行备案制,引入社会办医力量,私人医生能够发挥主观能动性;其次,大力推进医生和护士多点执业,允许医师定期在注册地点按照执业类别和执业范围从事执业活动;再次,大专院校要“认领”培育全科医生任务,完成临床实训基地和社区教学基地的实训,招生的前期可重点关注弱势地区生源,学校给予一定的招生倾斜政策,同时也鼓励学生毕业后返回生源地就业;最后,采用市场化有竞争力的薪酬留住家庭医生,制定最低薪酬水平,给予家庭医生在人员招聘、职称晋升、岗位聘用等方面与临床医学从业人员同等对待,并在职称评定和晋升方面制定额外的倾斜政策。第四,通过“互联网+”提高偏远地区医疗服务水平。一方面,建立和完善偏远地区医疗机构的信息化管理制度,偏远地区各级医疗机构与发达地区大医院信息互通,实现优势资源和信息技术的无缝对接;另一方面,借助远程医疗,加快分级诊疗领域的大数据和人工智能的推广和普及,建立远程会诊“基础网”,打造扁平化、零距离的远程医疗体系,让城市大医院与偏远地区医院连接,让大医院与偏远县乡村医疗机构连接,全面提升落后地区或医疗资源贫瘠地区的医疗服务能力。第五,提高居民大病和慢病基层就医费用报销比例。一方面,医疗保险报销在分级诊疗制度中具有中重要的“指挥棒”的作用,创新医保支付方式是促使居民自发“愿意去”基层医院的一个重要手段,根据分级诊疗的运行实际需求设置医保支付方式,全面支持参保居民与基层医疗卫生机构全科医师开展签约服务;另一方面,重点关注大病和慢病患者的报销比例,慢病是分级诊疗的切入口,大病又是造成居民因病致贫和因病返贫的关键因素,所以进一步提高慢病基层首诊和大病康复期转诊到基层阶段的报销比例具有重要意义。研究在如下几个方面尝试创新:第一,研究依据经典理论和模型,构建分级诊疗指标体系和实证分析模型,是现有经典理论和模型的拓展和新尝试。在Grossman健康需求理论和Andersen医疗服务利用模型基础之上,建立分级诊疗对居民健康影响模型和分级诊疗对家庭医疗经济负担影响模型。基于先决因素、使能因素和需求因素的体系框架,建立了分级诊疗影响因素体系,使得经典理论模型有了进一步的延伸应用,也使得分级诊疗制度效果研究有了经典的理论基础支持。第二,研究使用大型微观数据库作为数据支撑。现有文献虽然多认为分级诊疗是解决“看病难,看病贵”问题的关键举措,但是受实地调查难度限制,以地区小样本统计描述性分析为主。研究依托中国家庭追踪调查(CFPS)2014年和2016年数据,运用大型微观数据库进行大样本的研究分析。第三,实地调研国内典型地区,强化研究的实践意义。调研选择东部发达地区和西部欠发达地区,分别以东部发达省份和西部欠发达省份为例。在东部发达地区调研了医疗监管机构、三甲医院和基层医疗卫生机构,在西部欠发达省份开展了为期一周的问卷调研和访谈,走访了该省的1个市4个乡镇12个村,收集最重要的原始一手数据,增强了研究的实践意义。"	2019-12-01	2019	01		10.27296/d.cnki.gshcu.2019.000165
CMFD2022	利益相关者视角下的医联体管理问题研究	冯敏	南宁师范大学	南宁师范大学	医疗联合体;;利益相关者;;管理	"医疗联合体概念一被提出就被业界乃至社会各界广泛关注。近几年医疗联合体在各个国家大力推行,并且取得了重要成果和成功经验。医疗联合体的建立和发展有利于医疗体制的改革,组建医疗联合体,可以有效的发挥三级医院的专业技术优势,构建社区首诊制、双向转诊的诊疗模式,促进各级医疗卫生机构相互间的分工与协作,合理配置医疗卫生资源。但是目前国内的医疗联合体管理还不成熟,缺乏可以广泛适用的模式、操作的标准和范本式的程序。各利益相关者对医联体的认知较模糊。这都成为了我们亟待解决的问题。本文采用文献研究法、访谈法和问卷调查法等多种研究方法对医联体相关问题进行深入研究。本文运用问卷调查法及访谈法相结合的方式,比较全面的记录了一家基层卫生院―双沟镇中心卫生院以建立医疗联合体为切入点进行的医疗改革探索历程。面对医院的多重运行困境和发展困境,又恰逢从国家到省市出台相关医疗改革政策的出台,双沟中心卫生院做出与市中心医院建立紧密型医疗联合体的决策。本文分析了双沟分院面临的困境,得出建立医疗联合体的必要性和可行性。双沟分院医疗联合体在建设中得到政府和核心医院的大力支持,最终获得“二级综合医院”称号。实现了业务指标持续增长、居民享受更好用药待遇、技术水平明显提高、健全医院管理制度等显著成效。本文又通过文献研究等方法,分析双沟分院医疗联合体实施现状、初步成效及存在问题。本文参照利益相关者理论的研究观点,将医疗联合体的利益相关者分为三个层级即政府、医院、居民(患者)。首先调查医院对医疗联合体的认知情况,结合医院管理者访谈的形式,发现我国目前医疗联合体制度在实施过程中有医院医务人员对政策的认知度不高,医务人员积极性不高,双向转诊通道不顺畅,利益机制不协调以及基层服务能力不足等问题;调查居民(患者)对医疗联合体的了解情况、途径及态度,分析影响居民首诊机构的原因以及对双向转诊的意向等问题。综合以上调查情况,本文提出以下建议:政府需强化联合体政策顶层设计、完善卫生财政政策、加强社会宣传导向、完善药品目录等。医院需合理分配内部利益、建构合理运行机制、加快信息化建设、注重文化引导、完善双向转诊通道、加大人才培养力度等。"	2019-12-01	2019	06		10.27037/d.cnki.ggxsc.2019.000010

CMFD2022	上海市家庭医生服务体系优化研究	陈海沭	上海交通大学	上海交通大学	家庭医生制度;;家庭医生服务;;医疗服务供给;;医疗服务需求	"随着经济社会的快速发展和人民群众生活水平的不断提高,人们对医疗卫生服务的需求日益增加。在我国,尽管经过多年的医疗卫生服务发展和体系构建,但医疗卫生服务依然面临严峻挑战,“看病难、看病贵”问题依然突显。我国新医改实施以来,社区卫生服务是医疗卫生体制改革的重要内容,社区医疗卫生机构须承担起居民健康“守门人”的职责。在寻找适宜的社区卫生服务模式为居民提供优质的健康服务过程中,家庭医生服务被世界普遍认为是基层医疗卫生保健的最佳服务模式。上海作为我国经济发达城市,积极深化社区卫生服务改革,2011年起正式开始实践家庭医生责任制服务,提出到2020年全市将基本建立起“家庭医生制度框架”总体目标。宝山区被列为上海市首批家庭医生服务责任制试点区县之一。经过多年探索实践,宝山区17家社区卫生服务中心全部开展了家庭医生服务工作,覆盖了辖区所有村居委,积累了较丰富的数据和一定实践经验。由于家庭医生服务制度是一项程序复杂、涉及面广的民生工程,相比英、美、新加坡等发达国家的家庭医生医疗服务体系而言,我国家庭医生服务体系探索时间较短,目前仍处于探索的初步阶段,缺少完备的实践支撑,国内各地对家庭医生服务体系的研究尚未做出系统深入的分析。因此本文拟以宝山区为例,采用描述说明性和探索性调查研究方法,通过问卷调查、实地访谈、数据分析、文献研究,从供给和需求视角寻找出上海市家庭医生服务体系中存在的问题,提出家庭医生服务体系优化策略。本文首先对宝山区的家庭医生服务供给现状和需求现状做了一个调查汇总,通过从家庭医生数量、家庭医生服务内容、家庭医生服务方式、家庭医生服务有效利用、家庭医生服务认知、家庭医生服务满意度六个方面对家庭医生服务供需匹配情况进行细致的分析,认为目前上海市家庭医生服务体系的问题主要表现在家庭医生数量不足,难以对全人群提供高质量的家庭医生服务;医院与社区优势互补未形成,家庭医生因为资源少为居民提供服务处于被动局面,影响了服务效果;政策红利配套不足,居民希望得到的价格优惠、药品配备等福利政策在家庭医生服务中表现出获得感不强;家庭医生服务宣传与居民预期存在差距,宣传不到位和宣传不适度双重矛盾使得居民对家庭医生服务认知出现不了解、不理解,降低了服务利用率。在对问题进行分析的基础上,本文提出了家庭医生服务体系优化策略:1、根据不同人群的差别化需求分类提供家庭医生服务,分别为患病人群、重点人群、健康人群提供针对性服务;2、加强医疗机构间分工协作,通过社区首诊、双向转诊、“1+1+1”家庭医生签约服务和信息互联互通的推进促进有序诊疗秩序的构建,最终减轻群众就医负担;3、完善医疗保险制度和药品配备制度,为居民就医提供更多就医福利;4、开展适度有效宣传,加强医务人员和群众对家庭医生服务的正确理解,营造和谐医患关系,增强群众就医的获得感和满意度。本研究期望能够进一步整合医疗卫生资源,提高基层医疗卫生机构服务利用率,从而构建有序的诊疗服务机制,缓解看病难、看病贵的现实问题,实现“健康上海”的目标。"	2019-11-28	2019	05		10.27307/d.cnki.gsjtu.2019.004148

CMFD2020	医务社会工作介入分级诊疗过程研究	张Z雯	上海师范大学	上海师范大学	医务社会工作;;医联体;;分级诊疗;;生态系统理论	"研究者在沪上某二级甲等综合性医院担任医务社工,负责医务社会工作与志愿服务的推进工作。该医院于2015年12月加入到L医联体中,因此医务社会工作的服务范围从原本的“院内服务”逐步向“医联体内服务”延伸。分级诊疗涉及不同级别医院间的联动,医联体内的医务社工作为患者与医院沟通的桥梁,可以在这个过程中发挥积极作用,有助于协调医患关系、开展人文关爱、促进资源整合。本研究从各级医疗机构开展医务社会工作与志愿服务的渊源与实践出发,以L医联体为研究主体,涉及一家三级甲等医院、一家二级甲等医院和五家社务卫生服务中心,以这7家医院为主要研究场所。通过运用参与观察法和访谈法来搜集与研究主题相关的资料,探讨医务社会工作服务如何在“基层首诊、双向转诊、急慢分治、上下联动”分级诊疗模式中发挥作用。研究发现,在L医联体中,医务社会工作介入分级诊疗主要通过三种方式,其一,面向患者与居民的直接服务是医务社会工作介入的根本,在微观层面充分运用个案管理的方法,在中观层面孵化多元化的项目,在宏观方面促进社区资源的联动协作,有效提升分级诊疗患者的就医体验。其二,医务社工与志愿服务联动是医务社会工作介入的抓手,从招募爱心人士到培育公益队伍至助力基地建设,联动志愿服务组建专业团队,为分级诊疗的落实提供软性服务的基础,营造人文关爱的氛围。其三,普及社会工作理念和方法的间接服务是重要保障,专业社工轮岗实习,多层次培训与督导,继续教育推广实务,在分级诊疗的医疗体系中渗透医务社会工作专业服务。研究发现专业医务社工人才缺乏、社工角色定位界限模糊、医疗团队合作遇到阻力、资源整合遇到行业壁垒是当前医务社会工作介入分级诊疗的主要问题。研究者由此提出在三个层次的介入建议。在微观系统上,要全面打造医务社工队伍,精准把握患者多元需求,引导转变就医理念;在中观系统,要联动志愿者培育公益文化,促进多学科多专业合作,鼓励跨行业跨领域联动;在宏观系统层面中,要倡导社区健康相关政策,参与社区公共健康服务,推动疾病预防体系建立。"	2019-11-01	2019	02		10.27312/d.cnki.gshsu.2019.000053
CMFD2020	分级诊疗对镇江市综合类三甲医院经济运行的影响及政策建议	于波	江苏大学	江苏大学	分级诊疗;;经济运行;;公益性	"分级诊疗对综合类三甲医院经济运行的影响是加快推进我国分级诊疗政策建设、促进医疗卫生资源合理利用的关键,同样也是国家医药卫生制度改革发展的重要环节。然而,随着市场经济体制的不断改革,各层级医疗机构往往以自身利益为中心呈现出医疗市场竞争格局,在医疗卫生服务体系内,各专业自治主体为了寻得自身发展容易产生诱导需求、过度提供或选择性提供医疗服务。此外,伴随国民经济收入水平的提高,社会大众对高质量的医疗服务需求也相应增加,因而会直接选择前往城市综合类医院寻求服务,无形之中阻碍了分级诊疗的推进工作。因此,在面对医疗卫生资源不足、各层级医疗机构目标发展不明、居民生活质量不断提高以及高质量的医疗服务需求日益提升的现实背景下,如何明确各层级医疗机构的目标定位和满足各利益相关者的利益诉求成为本研究所要解决的重点问题。鉴于此,本研究首先结合相关文献,系统梳理了有关分级诊疗对综合类三甲医院经济运行影响的相关理论,归纳了影响综合类三甲医院经济运行所涉及的因素,在此基础上运用对比分析法,观察在政策实行后综合类三甲医院收入、支出、运营、效率以及控费的变化情况;其次,通过收入、成本分析法,研究综合类三甲医院在分级诊疗实行过程中关键的行为策略,并说明正面及负面影响;最后运用专家访谈法,分析了综合类三甲医院在改革中的实践成效。研究结果:在镇江市实施分级诊疗政策过程中,经实证分析综合类三甲医院的门急诊人次增长率和出院人数增长率均有所下降,下降原因与分级诊疗政策的实施有密切联系。研究发现镇江市综合类三甲医院门急诊人次和出院人数在2015年均呈现负增长。通过对镇江市康复联合病房的效果研究以及病种分级诊疗的研究,发现推行基于病种分类和上下联动,实施医疗联合体模式下的分级诊疗可以引导患者完成基层首诊的目标,减轻患者的就医压力和就医成本。相反,综合类三甲医院会因分级诊疗政策的实施造成服务量与医疗收入的减少,伴随着经济运行也将受到影响。基于上述研究,得出研究结论:分级诊疗可以引导患者分流,降低患者就医成本和负担,对各层级医疗机构明确其目标定位发展有积极作用;由于政策在实施中对综合类三甲医院的医疗服务量具有控制作用,因此对综合类三甲医院的收支状况也造成影响。经研究,发现分级诊疗政策是明确各层级医疗机构的目标发展方向,同时也是构建稳定就医秩序的关键环节,实施医疗联合体模式下的分级诊疗制度,可以完善医疗卫生资源的市场配置,明确各层级医疗机构目标发展定位,提高患者健康水平与健康保障,以此来解决患者“看病难,看病贵”的健康难题。"	2019-11-01	2019	05		10.27170/d.cnki.gjsuu.2019.000168

CMFD2020	基于成本收益分析法的远程诊疗模式研究	荆进	浙江大学	浙江大学	医联体;;分级诊疗;;远程问诊;;医疗影像平台;;成本分析法	"当今社会,随着人们生活水平的逐步提高,人口老龄化的问题日趋严重,人们对医疗保健的需求也不断提高,而“看病难,看病贵”长期以来都是人民群众最关心的问题,医疗资源的配置结构不合理、医疗资源在地域间分布不均是造成这一问题的主要原因。针对这些问题,近些年来,中央国务院积极推进医疗联合体(以下简称“医联体”)建设,深化医疗卫生体制改革,发布了多项规划指导意见,各方医疗单位积极探索医联体建设,不断完善分级诊疗体系,形成了城市医联体、医共体、跨区域的专科联盟和远程诊疗协作网等四种医联体形式。而第三方影像平台可以通过连通各级医院,优化就医流程、提高服务效率,以期推动分级诊疗的发展进程。通过研究发现,目前越来越多的远程诊疗平台向为抢占医院资源免费投放设备、系统,但极少数能够真正发挥作用服务于分级诊疗体系。大部分平台未进行市场细分,并没有找到合适的可持续的商业模式,导致远程诊疗未能实现普及。针对目前远程诊疗的推进困难问题,本文通过对大量国内外文献进行研究,并进行走访调研,发现医疗影像平台作为远程诊疗的一种实现手段,能够真正服务于分级诊疗体系。本文将重点研究其可行性,通过建立三级、二级、一级医院医院数量、就诊人次、抽成比率、远程诊断量等参数模型,采用成本分析法对该模式进行可行性分析,为现阶段的远程问诊有效推进提供可持续、可复制的解决方案。并以汕头某三甲医院为样本,采用成本分析法探讨该医院形成的医联体体系是否可以实现医院、医生、患者、医疗影像平台的多方获利。本文通过研究得出以下结论:(1)医疗影像平台能够将医联体中各个医院的影像数据统一进行云存储,可以根据医院的需求提供全托管、半托管的服务模式,由上级医院或专家写片中心协助下级医院出具诊断报告,使医疗资源得到优化配置,助力分级诊疗制度的真正落地。(2)在成本分析的模型假设中,由于医疗影像平台运营的成本相对固定,在人口密集度越高的地区,病患群体越大,进行X-Ray、CT、MRI等项目检查的人次也相应越多,医疗影像平台能够在较短的时间内实现成本覆盖并能够产生盈余,获得盈利的时间周期也相应越短。(3)通过实证研究,以汕大附一院医联体为例,根据模型假设和数据分析,服务于汕大附一院医联体的医疗影像平台在第二年产生盈利,并且收益持续,证实了该医疗影像平台模式的可行性、盈利的可持续性、以及商业模式的可复制性。"	2019-09-01	2019	01

CMFD2020	我国分级诊疗制度的政策实践研究	李重	山西大学	山西大学	医疗改革;;分级诊疗;;政策实践;;激励相容	"“分级诊疗”这一概念的出现离不开国外先进经验,更与我国的医疗卫生事业的发展密不可分,是我国将世界上“三级医疗服务”、“守门人制度”和“转诊系统”的经验融于我国实际国情的一项具有中国特色的制度发展。国务院2015年在《关于推进分级诊疗制度建设的指导意见》中提出了“到2020年,基层首诊、双向转诊、急慢分治、上下联动的分级诊疗模式逐步形成,基本建立符合国情的分级诊疗制度”的目标。从新公共服务理论的角度看,这一目标意在构建的“以人为本”的基本医疗卫生服务,对于我国公共医疗的完善和发展具有十分重大的意义。近年来,我国的分级诊疗制度的政策实践取得了一定成果,主要在于医联体的建设、医疗信息化的推进、医疗人才的强化和医保政策的完善,并已经取得了基层医疗服务能力稳步提升、双向转诊势头良好、人才流动更加活跃的可喜成就。但从2018中国卫生健康统计年鉴的数据来看,仍然任重道远的是,资源配置需要更加完善合理,上下转诊要提升规模、提高效率,尤其是最基本的医卫人员,需不断优化其素质,拓展其数量。为满足分级诊疗制度设计之初的期待,本论文试图利用文献研究法和定性分析法,在解读分级诊疗制度的顶层设计初衷、总结其政策实践中的经验和不足的基础上,从利益相关者理论出发对其利益相关者间的冲突进行梳理。发现在机制设计理论视野下,分级诊疗制度的政策实践中的三个主要利益相关者(政府、医疗机构及其卫生技术人员、患者)呈现出的博弈冲突是其推进困难的重要因素,目前尚存在的不充分激励相容和信息不均衡亟需得到重视。因此按照夯实根基、理顺脉络、重视发展的思路,对提高分级诊疗制度的政策实践效果提出三个方面的建议:一是重视增强我国医疗资源配置的有效性,二是重视分级诊疗中相关各方的激励相容,三是重视医疗领域的信息流通。本论文的创新之处主要有三:一是对公共政策科学中政策执行研究的中国特色化发展。在公共政策研究中,西方的政策执行研究成果虽颇丰,但由于尚未形成定论,且根据我国特有的中国特色政治体制与政策执行风格,在对我国具体政策的研究过程中,不宜生搬硬套西方理论。为了区别于西方的政策执行研究,本文斟酌使用“政策实践”这一词汇以区别“政策执行”一词。但值得借鉴的是,西方政策执行研究中提出的,政策执行的主体、对象及其影响因素,在政策执行中至关重要。因此在我国分级诊疗制度的政策实践研究中,针对政策相关各方和整个组织过程,选择了利益相关者理论和机制设计理论,以便对我国分级诊疗制度的政策实践展开更恰当的研究。这引出了第二点,即对分级诊疗制度的政策实践这一课题的研究视角的创新。基于利益相关者理论,论文从机制设计理论的视角梳理了市场经济体制下分级诊疗进一步完善所值得引起重视的内部冲突。三是对提高分级诊疗制度的政策实践效果的对策思路的创新。结合理论分析结果,论文在提出建议的同时,关注我国分级诊疗制度政策效果的整体优化和未来发展,把握制度顶层设计,立足于实践,着眼过去、现在和未来,旨在为我国分级诊疗制度做一点微薄的贡献。"	2019-06-01	2019	01		10.27284/d.cnki.gsxiu.2019.000839
CMFD2020	社区卫生服务机构参与居家养老服务能力研究	杜凝	西北大学	西北大学	居家养老;;社区卫生服务;;服务意愿;;参与能力;;对策措施	"自20世纪70年代起,如何应对人口老龄化便成为全世界人民共同关注的话题。老龄问题不断加剧,由此对养老服务和医疗供给服务提出了更高质量的要求。在多元的养老方式中,居家养老是以社会组织为服务主体、为居住在家的老年人提供基本生活照料服务的一种养老模式。通过“居家养老”+“社区照料”的方式,既能够缓解政府和家庭承担的沉重养老压力,也可以满足老年人“落叶归根”的心理需求,居家养老成为老年人首选的养老方式。但居家养老面临的首要困难在于,老年人由于身体机能下降、出行不便,使得其很难做到及时就医,最终导致病情加重甚至恶化。为居家养老的老年人提供便利、高效的医疗卫生服务关系着老年人的健康指数与幸福度。而社区卫生服务从其功能定位而言,正好能解决二、三级医院和居民之间“最后一公里”的问题。基于此,本文将研究重点聚焦在社区卫生服务机构参与居家养老服务的能力,该能力既包括实际的医疗诊断水平、设备供应能力等硬性实际参与能力,也包括医护人员的参与意愿与态度,并以此形成了一个基本的研究逻辑:即首先借助社会支持网络理论与老年人医疗需求研究成果,建立科学、全面的分析研究框架,并以此为基点,通过个案访谈的方式了解医护人员的参与意愿,最终得出社区卫生服务机构参与居家养老的综合能力分析结果。结果显示,社区卫生服务机构在居民中的认知程度不高、政策支持力度小、机构缺乏资金和硬件支持、医护人员发展空间受限且工作负荷大。最后针对调研中所发现的以上问题以及在访谈中医护人员所提出的建议,从拓宽长处方试点、完善双向转诊、增加针对性服务和健全家庭医生制度等方面提出对策建议,希望以此来优化提升社区卫生服务机构的参与能力。"	2019-06-01	2019	01

CMFD2019	基于分级诊疗视角下武汉市社区卫生服务中心规划及患者流控制优化研究	程思宇	湖北中医药大学	湖北中医药大学	分级诊疗;;社区卫生服务中心;;患者流	"党的十八届六中全会进一步提出合理优化配置医疗资源,构建分级诊疗服务体系,为医疗卫生服务体系和基本医疗保障制度改革指明了方向,这是新时期深化医改的重要内容之一。目前,持续紧张的医患关系是我国的现状,不断发生的“医患冲突”事件,被广大人民群众重视,更是被各媒体关注。由于医疗资源配置失衡,优质医疗资源过度集中导致“看病难”的存在。以当前武汉市社区卫生服务中心布局规划设计可行性为原则,分别从理论及应用方面进行全面分析和深入探究,利用模型构建充分模拟武汉市社区卫生服务中心机构布局规划选址影响因素,并对相关因素进行分析对比,优化模拟结构,利用“患者流”控制与“排队论”等实际问题,结合居民实际需求,在医疗服务需求差异性的条件下,实现患者流控制优化,对相关区域社区卫生服务中心的规划进行优化合理布局,从而达到分级诊疗这一目的。利用对武汉市社区卫生服务中心网络最优规划布局设计,对“患者流”进行数学建模和仿真模拟,可以为武汉市分级诊疗提供一定的理论指导,扩大社区卫生服务中心的相关医疗职能,提高社区卫生医疗资源的可及性及医疗机构的利用率,从而优化配置了武汉市社区卫生服务中心的医疗服务系统,提升武汉市社区卫生服务中心运作效率。对武汉社区卫生服务中心现有布局进行分析,了解各街道居民对基础医疗的需求,总结社区居民的就医习惯,进一步探索影响患者就医选择的影响因素,为构建数学模型求解、探究患者愿意跨区就诊的比例、检验患者就医的路径距离等提供支撑依据。并在此基础上,对社区卫生服务中心布局规划进行灵敏度分析,进一步拓展患者愿意跨区就诊距离和比例关系对社区卫生服务中心承担分级就诊的影响因素。利用堵塞排队网络理论和Jackson网络理论,深入分析居民就诊时排队问题,构建各级医疗服务系统排队子系统模型,在理论系统的支持下,分别探索影响患者就医带堵塞模型及不带堵塞模型的因素,构建社区卫生服务中心初诊服务模型。以此,优化患者到上级综合医院挂号-就诊的决策,试图挖掘患者优先到综合医院就诊的内在机理,为推行分级诊疗提供相关理论依据。根据社区患者优先就医决策研究和社区卫生服务中心布局规划的成果,构建城市二级医疗系统分诊政策建议,为社区卫生服务中心的资源配置和布局规划、患者流控制优化提供政策参考。本文的目的是根据武汉市医疗卫生资源配置现状,试图设计规划社区卫生服务中心的布局,构建患者流控制优化模型,将患者流控制与社区卫生服务中心布局结合起来,研究和分析其影响因素得出社区卫生服务中心合理布局设计和患者流控制优化解,为贯彻和落实分级诊疗政策提供理论依据和实践的指导。"	2019-05-22	2019	09		
CMFD2020	基本医疗保险对患者就医行为的影响研究	万梦云	中南财经政法大学	中南财经政法大学	医保报销比;;就医行为;;基层医疗机构;;分级诊疗	"长期以来,在医疗体制行政等级制下,我国医疗资源呈现出医疗资源和患者均向大医院集聚的现象,医疗机构资源配置和使用不尽合理,“看病难、看病贵”问题日益严重。为此,国家着力建设以“基层首诊”为核心的分级诊疗体系,引导患者积极选择基层医疗机构就医,实现各级医疗机构间的合理分流。有学者提出,在以分级诊疗为重点的新医改中,应着重发挥医疗保险的引导作用,并且在各地分级诊疗的实践中,大部分地区均通过设置医疗保险的差异化报销政策引导居民向基层就医,那么,差异化报销政策在分级诊疗中是否发挥了引导作用?不同医疗保险对患者就医行为的影响是否存在差异呢?尚未得到回答。本文以城乡患者的就医行为为切入点,将就医行为分为疾病处理方式和就医机构选择两个阶段,并根据Andersen卫生服务利用模型将自变量划分为医疗保险、需求因素、能力因素、倾向因素和其他因素,利用Probit模型分别进行回归,以研究不同医疗保险对患者就医行为的影响是否存在差异以及基本医疗保险是否有效发挥了引导门诊患者向基层就医的作用,进而为促进患者积极就医、促进医疗资源下沉基层,完善分级诊疗提供意见和建议。通过研究发现:(1)不同医疗保险对患者的疾病处理方式影响差异明显,与城职保相比,新农合患者患病后的就医概率更低,城居保并无显著差异。(2)医疗保险的差异化报销政策并未发挥引导门诊患者基层就医的作用,即报销比例高的基层医疗机构并不能有效吸引患者积极选择基层医疗机构。(3)提供医疗保健服务能显著影响患者就医行为。据此,本文建议从整合基本医保制度,促进制度公平;积极引进优质医师入基层,增强基层医疗机构的服务能力;充分发挥医疗保险的利益调节作用;落实基层首诊;鼓励基层提供医疗保健服务五方面入手,促进医保作用的发挥,改变患者的就医行为。本文的创新点在于尝试拓展细化了医保影响患者就医行为的研究领域:(1)在医保基本实现全面覆盖的背景下,本文探讨了覆盖人群广泛的新农合、城职保和城居保对患者就医行为影响的差异,以为促进我国医保制度的公平与完善提供针对性的意见和建议。(2)本文首次基于全国性调查数据,从医保差异化报销政策的角度评估医疗保险的作用,通过实证分析,明确检验了医保差异化报销政策对患者的门诊就医机构选择产生的影响。本文上研究的不足在于:囿于可用的数据资源,本文无法确认患者所选的就医机构是首诊还是转诊,仅能表现大致的就诊流向,此外,由于本文主要研究近四周患病且在门诊看病的样本,样本量较小,未分城乡样本检验,医保对城乡患者影响是否存在差异还有待进一步研究。"	2019-05-20	2019	09

CDFD2020	分级诊疗模式下患者就医行为与机构选择研究	陈意	合肥工业大学	合肥工业大学	分级诊疗;;就医行为;;机构选择;;不确定决策;;演化博弈	"近年来,人民生活水平不断提高,健康需求日益增长,但我国卫生资源总量不足、结构不合理、基层服务能力薄弱等问题仍比较突出。分级诊疗已经成为国家深化医药卫生体制改革,促进基本医疗卫生服务均等化的重要举措。分级诊疗制度的实施对于促进医药卫生事业的长远健康发展、提高人民健康水平、保障和改善民生具有重要意义。推进和完善分级诊疗制度更是实现健康中国战略的必要路径。国务院“十三五”深化医药卫生体制改革规划指明要坚持居民自愿、基层首诊、政策引导、创新机制,建立科学合理的分级诊疗制度。虽然全国各地积极探索多种形式的分级诊疗模式,推动形成基层首诊、双向转诊、急慢分治、上下联动的就医新秩序,但是分级诊疗的实施成效不明显,未达到预期效果。现有研究集中探索了传统医疗服务模式改进、不均衡医疗资源配置优化等问题,关注焦点集中在政府、医院等医疗服务供给主体上,忽略了患者作为医疗服务关键需求主体在医疗服务过程中的行为选择。鉴于此,本文将医疗服务需求侧作为重点研究对象,基于就医行为理论和不确定决策理论,围绕分级诊疗模式下患者就医行为和机构选择开展研究,对于丰富就医行为理论和机构选择方法体系,完善分级诊疗制度建设和实施具有重要的理论意义和实践价值。本文围绕分级诊疗模式下患者就医行为和机构选择问题,在对现有分级诊疗模式和患者就医行为研究总结回顾的基础上,凝练了患者就医行为存在影响因素众多、决策信息复杂、利益主体多元等特征,通过实证分析系统研究了分级诊疗模式下患者就医行为意向的关键影响因素,提出了面向多源不确定信息和个体差异化偏好的个体患者就医机构选择方法,构建了多元主体参与下群体患者就医演化博弈模型并分析了患者就医机构选择的演化过程,通过案例研究和仿真模拟验证了所提模型的有效性。本文的具体研究内容和创新点如下:(1)分级诊疗模式下患者就医行为影响机理分析。研究基于计划行为理论和安德森医疗卫生服务利用模型构建了患者就医机构选择影响因素模型;以此模型为基础设计了患者就医行为意向影响因素测量问卷,并通过网络问卷调查采集数据;在问卷和模型通过检验的基础上,构建了结构方程模型分别对患者基层首诊就医意向和大医院首诊就医意向进行探索分析,揭示了不同影响因素对患者基层首诊就医意向和大医院首诊就医意向的影响机理,为引导患者基层首诊以及合理选择就医机构提供参考。(2)面向不确定信息和差异化偏好的个体患者就医机构选择。研究分析了个体患者就医机构选择问题,针对分级诊疗模式和互联网环境下患者就医行为特征,设计了一种互联网环境下患者就医机构选择框架;在决策框架基础上,描述了个性化决策准则空间构建、信息来源及其多样化表达形式,引入了新的赋权规则用于描述个体患者的差异化偏好,提出了一种改进的随机多准则可接受度分析方法用于生成患者备选就医机构的完全排序;利用了由个体患者信息、医疗机构统计信息和第三方平台信息组成的现实世界多源数据集,验证了所提患者就医机构选择方法的可行性和有效性。(3)多元主体参与下群体患者就医机构选择演化分析。研究分析了分级诊疗模式下医疗服务体系中的利益相关主体,构建了关键参与主体医院和患者间的演化博弈模型,设计了医院和患者间的博弈策略和支付矩阵,分析了博弈双方演化均衡策略及其稳定性;利用Matlab仿真模拟了患者和医院间的演化博弈模型并依据现有分级诊疗实施情况设定初始参数;通过调整不同参数探索了分级诊疗模式下策略选择初始比例、政府财政支持、医院实施成本和患者及医院收益等关键因素对患者和医院策略选择演化结果产生的影响,基于此提出了深入推进和完善分级诊疗的相关措施建议。综上所述,如何引导患者科学合理地选择就医机构、保证患者在医疗服务体系中有序流动是分级诊疗完全实现的重要突破口。本文从医疗服务需求侧的角度出发,揭示了患者就医行为的影响机理,提出了以患者就医为中心的医疗机构选择方法,探索了影响患者群体基层首诊的策略选择,为建立科学合理的分级诊疗模式提供了重要参考。值得注意的是,为了保证医疗健康事业的可持续发展,科学决策方法的推广应用和反馈改进是我们将面临的一个新的挑战。与此同时,随着互联网服务的不断深入以及人工智能技术的飞速进步,文本、图像、视频等多源多模态数据呈指数级增长,如何通过获取、处理和融合多源多模态海量数据,为患者提供个性化、精准化的医疗服务将会成为未来的重要研究方向。"	2019-05-01	2019	03		10.27101/d.cnki.ghfgu.2019.000510
CMFD2023	分级诊疗对城乡居民基本医疗保险基金风险的影响研究	刘灿	武汉大学	武汉大学	城乡居民基本医疗保险;;分级诊疗;;系统动力学;;基金风险;;政策仿真	"自2016年起,为促进城乡一体化发展、更好地维护医疗保障制度的公平性,新型农村合作医疗和城镇居民基本医疗保险开始在全国范围内整合为城乡居民基本医疗保险制度。与此同时,各地医疗保险基金支出快速增加,多地甚至出现了基金收不抵支的险情,对于基金风险的预测和研究显得尤为重要。本文从实施分级诊疗的角度出发,探究分级诊疗带来的就医流向优化对基金风险的具体影响,在此基础上,找出基金收支环节的其他风险影响因素,并分析综合性的政策调整对缓解基金风险的作用。本文选择湖北省E市作为案例,利用2013-2017年城乡居民医保基金收支的相关数据,找到E市基金主要的风险因素包括缺乏动态筹资机制、医疗费用增长过快和不合理的就医流向。在梳理E市城乡居民医保制度发展的基础上,借助系统动力学理论和Vensim软件,构建了系统动力学模型,预测了E市2013-2033年基金的运行情况,重点对分级诊疗政策实施后,就医流向的优化对基金收支的影响做了政策仿真,同时对筹资和医疗费用等政策参数进行微调,进而分析不同政策调整对基金的影响大小,找到基金动态调整过程中最合理的政策参数组合,提出合理的政策建议。研究结果表明,模型仿真的结果误差均不超过2%,能够较好地反映现实基金收支发展情况。E市将从2018年开始,基金收入持续低于基金支出,在2029年基金累计结余耗尽,2033年的基金累计亏损达到5142.8万元。通过改变就医流向参数后模拟分级诊疗政策实施,结果显示,分级诊疗政策能在短期内缓解一定的基金压力,但从长期来看,即便达到最合理的就医流向,基金仍然会出现亏损,无法达到平稳运行的要求。进一步调整筹资和次均费用参数后发现,如果人均筹资额提高10%,次均费用降低5%,基金能在预测期内保持“略有结余”的健康水平,缓解基金风险。根据政策仿真结果,本文提出了如下的政策建议:第一,完善和落实分级诊疗制度,必须要重构分级诊疗制度逻辑、加强基层卫生服务能力、通过配套措施改革引导基层就医、转变患者就医观念;第二,通过支付方式改革和加强监管控制医疗费用过快增长;第三,建立长效的筹资机制,明确筹资依据,拓展筹资渠道;第四,按照风险预警的要求,构建地方风险预警系统。"	2019-05-01	2019	01		10.27379/d.cnki.gwhdu.2019.001301

CMFD2020	天津市分级诊疗的现状分析与对策研究	张兆东	天津医科大学	天津医科大学	天津市;;分级诊疗;;双向转诊;;发展现状;;完善措施	"目的:本文通过研究国内外实施分级诊疗制度的发展现状和先进经验,结合天津市实施分级诊疗制度采取的措施及运行状况,并通过文献研究、访谈及问卷调查和相关分析,探讨天津市实施分级诊疗过程中存在的问题及其影响因素,从而提出完善天津市分级诊疗制度的对策与措施,促进其健康发展。方法:1、文献研究:基于pub med、web of science、中国知网、维普、万方数据库、中国医学文献等数据库的文献检索,获得国内外关于分级诊疗相关文献资料,并进行分析研究,涉及到国家、省、市等宏观及基层各级医疗机构资料。同时从天津市统计年鉴、天津市卫健委卫生统计资料获取分级诊疗相关的数据信息,并进行数据分析。2、专家访谈:运用德尔菲法在天津市内选取具有代表性的医疗机构及卫生部门展开面对面访谈,主要访谈内容有:分级诊疗实施以来辖区内医疗服务的供需情况、变动趋势,存在的主要问题以及促进分级诊疗政策落实的具体办法和改进措施。3、问卷调查:针对医生、患者、卫生部门分别制作与分级诊疗相关的问卷,并计算相关问卷信度和效度,收集处理信息,建立相应数据库,应用统计软件SPSS 24.0录入分析,选取χ~2检验和回归分析,以α=0.05为检验水准,其中P<0.05,则认为结果具有统计学意义。结果:1、通过对社会人口学因素和服务质量因素等12个指标进行多元逻辑回归分析检验,统计结果表明影响患者选择分级诊疗就诊的主要因素包括被调查患者的年龄、文化程度以及患者对方便快捷就医、医疗价格、医疗质量、服务能力和医保报销比例的满意程度等因素。其中,年龄、文化程度和医疗服务价格为危险因素;方便快捷就医、医疗质量、服务能力、报销比例等服务质量因素为保护因素。2、天津市基层医疗机构与二、三级医院相比,其医疗卫生资源相对不足。如注册护士数相对较少、医护比(1:0.93)与国家(1:1.25)要求存在差距,基层医务人员学历层次、职称级别相对较低,基层医疗机构设备投入不足,与国家提出的“强基层、保基本、建机制”的要求还有较大差距。3、天津市分级诊疗制度实施以来,社区医院门诊人次占比(2017年)较前两年有所提升,“小病在社区、大病去医院、康复回社区”的卫生资源合理利用局面略有显现。但还存在着居民对于分级诊疗的知晓率和满意率不高、双向转诊意愿低,医联体内部转诊不畅的问题。4、近年来天津市采取多种措施保障分级诊疗政策运行,但进展状况并不十分明显。调查数据显示,医务人员“多点执业”占比(24.6%)低、变化小。表明分级诊疗保障措施落实不到位,如医疗风险防范、法律保护、人事制度改革等措施有待加强。结论:天津市卫生资源分布逐渐向基层医疗机构倾斜,但与二三级医院仍存在差距。天津市分级诊疗工作在一定程度上达到分流患者,将“小病”患者留在基层医疗机构的目标,但在分级诊疗的认知程度上还需进一步提升,医联体内部双向转诊需要从制度层面和标准层面加以完善。天津市分级诊疗制度的政策保障尚需补齐短板、抓落实,如“多点执业”的医疗安全、风险防范、人事制度等需要从法律层面不断完善。不同等级的医保报销政策和机制还需要进行调整。"	2019-05-01	2019	03		
CMFD2020	天津市社区医疗服务模式问题研究	杨亚丽	天津财经大学	天津财经大学	社区医疗服务模式;;分级诊疗;;医联体;;医疗资源整合	"“十二五”期间,天津市卫生计生工作坚持以深化改革、便民惠民为主线,各项工作顺利进行,卫生计生事业取得了显著进展和成效。为了进一步推进天津市卫生计生事业的不断发展,更好地满足城乡居民卫生计生服务的需求,提高人民群众地健康水平,天津市根据国家“十三五”规划纲要的要求,在2016年10月份颁布了《天津市卫生计生事业发展“十三五”规划》,提出了在规划期限内天津卫生计生事业发展的各项指标。该规划特别加大了对社区医疗服务的投入,目前已经取得了比较满意的效果。但也出现了一些难以解决的问题。目前国内学术界关于本专题的研究成果,大多集中在对社区医疗服务进行一般性的阐述及对现状的总结上,而缺乏全面而深入的研究,至于对整个社区医疗服务体制、实施机制以及具体的对策研究少之又少。本文的创新之处在于,以公共服务的两个基础理论――即新公共服务理论、公共选择理论为分析手段,将本世纪初曾经领先于全国的天津市社区医疗服务模式,与目前在全国具有典型意义的深圳社区医疗服务模式进行全面而深入的比较研究,同时参照国外三个国家的社区医疗服务模式,总结出天津市社区医疗服务模式在服务体制、运行机制以及具体的实施措施等方面存在的问题,从而针对性地提出了一套社区医疗服务体制、机制、实施措施的对策与建议。本文通过比较分析法、问卷调查法以及访谈法等研究方法,对天津市社区医疗问题进行详细的剖析,指出天津市社区医疗服务目前存在的问题,为自己的对策与建议打下逻辑基础。"	2019-05-01	2019	07		10.27354/d.cnki.gtcjy.2019.000552
CMFD2020	医联体联动模式对基层医疗机构发展的影响研究	连颖菁	福建医科大学	福建医科大学	医疗联合体;;基层医疗机构;;效果评价;;数据包络法;;优劣解距离法	"目的:在推动医联体建设以提升基层卫生服务能力的背景下,探索福建省现行两种医联体模式内核心医院与基层医疗机构的协作方式,总结主要做法,评价不同医联体模式内基层医疗机构发展的实际效果,针对存在的问题提出相应的建议,为进一步推进医联体的深入发展提供借鉴。方法:本研究数据资料主要来源于福建省卫生计生统计资料汇编、相关年鉴数据和问卷调查等,结合定量分析和定性分析的方法进行研究。利用文献研究法分析与归纳当前医联体及基层医疗机构发展的政策环境、福建省两种不同模式医联体建设情况及主要做法等,同时应用描述性统计学方法分析不同医联体模式下对基层医疗机构卫生服务变化的影响。运用数据包络法评价医联体内基层医疗机构的相对效率与改革前后效率的变化,并采用TOPSIS法评价基层医疗机构的综合效益变化。在此基础上,开展问卷调查了解居民对基层医疗机构卫生服务满意度以及医务人员对参与组建医联体后基层医疗机构提供卫生服务的评价,通过访谈法了解基层管理者与医务人员对医联体建设的看法与面临的问题。结果:(1)当前各级政府为医联体的发展提供了坚实的政策基础,现有的医联体模式可以分为三大类:“契约式”松散型医联体、“过渡式”半紧密型医联体和以产权链接为主的紧密型医联体。(2)根据福建省两种不同模式医联体内核心医院与基层医疗机构的协作方式对基层卫生服务的影响可知,松散型和紧密型医联体模式下基层医疗机构门急诊服务量均有提升,但住院服务量均下降了。(3)数据分析表明,综合效益评价结果为,松散型医联体对基层医疗机构的发展的影响作用并不显著,而紧密型医联体内基层医疗机构的发展态势逐年趋好,很大程度上推动基层医疗机构的发展。效率评价结果为两种医联体模式内基层医疗机构的总体效率均值都小于1,且全要素生产率均值呈下降趋势,两者主要均受技术变化的影响。(4)根据问卷调查的结果可知:在居民评价方面,总体上,居民对医联体的知晓率不高(34.2%)、双向转诊的参与度低(9.7%)。紧密型医联体模式下居民对医联体及其相关政策的了解比例、对基层医疗机构服务提供的满意度、基层首诊以及利用转诊服务的频数均高于松散型模式下居民(P>0.05)。在医务人员评价方面,超过半数的医务人员(51.5%)对医联体内上级医院帮扶与培训形式的评价为不满意,其中,松散型占56.5%,紧密型占44.8%,频数分布与差异具有统计学意义(P<0.05);对于双向转诊,“没有进行转诊病人”最多,可见医联体内开展双向转诊效果并不理想。结论:当前不同模式的医联体建设对提升基层医疗机构实施的效果有待进一步加强。在此基础上,为深入推动医联体带动基层医疗机构发展,从政府支持和政策保障方面、医联体内帮扶形式方面以及居民方面等角度出发,提出促进福建省医联体内基层医疗机构建设的政策建议;着力推动松散型医联体向紧密型医联体过渡,更好地提升基层卫生服务能力,以满足居民卫生服务的需要。"	2019-05-01	2019	07		10.27020/d.cnki.gfjyu.2019.000364

CMFD2020	城市医联体背景下基层医疗机构服务能力提升路径研究	李亚男	江西中医药大学	江西中医药大学	分级诊疗;;医联体;;基层医疗机构;;服务能力	"分级诊疗的提出是为了形成一个基层首诊、双向转诊、急慢分诊、上下联动的诊疗秩序,而医联体则是促进分级诊疗发展的基础和关键。医联体是指区域医疗联合体,是将同一个区域内的医疗资源整合在一起,通常由一个区域内的三级医院与二级医院、基层医疗机构及其他不同类型的医疗机构组成的一个医疗联合体。医联体的构建明确了各级医疗机构的职责,通过双向转诊的形式为百姓解决“看病难”的问题。即患者在基层医疗机构进行首诊,若有转诊的需要,则逐级向上级医院转诊,待患者病情稳定或处于康复期时,再转至基层医院进行治疗。我国的基层医疗机构便扮演着“守门人”的角色,基层机构要能够对常见病进行诊治,对急重症病人进行转诊,对康复期病人进行康复及护理。由此可见,基层医疗机构在医联体运行的过程中起着“接得了”“接得住”的作用。“接得了”主要是指在基层首诊时,基层医生对患者的病情可以做出正确合理的诊断与处理。“接得住”是指患者在上级医院接受诊治后,回到基层进行康复治疗时,基层医疗机构可以为患者提供所需的医疗服务。不难看出,基层医疗机构在医联体的运行中,承担着患者前期首诊和后期康复、护理三大环节的责任,同时也肩负着预防保健和家庭医生签约服务的重要职责,是医联体运行的重要基石。但现实情况表明,医联体背景下当前我国基层医疗卫生机构存在着诸如医疗服务能力低下、康复资源短缺、护理范围过大、家庭医生签约发展不平衡等一系列问题,制约着医联体的运行。本文以全国多城市基层医疗机构全部加入医疗联合体为背景,从城市医联体背景下基层医疗机构的功能定位入手,在全面分析基层医疗机构在预防、医疗、康复、护理以及家庭医生签约服务方面存在问题的基础上,探讨导致问题的根本原因、制度问题以及思想上存在的约束,并进一步从上级医院、基层医疗机构以及政府相关部门三个方面提出提升基层医疗机构服务能力的对策,最终提出医疗机构“去行政化”再“市场化”的路径,以期推进基层医疗机构服务能力提升,促进医联体发展,为分级诊疗事业做贡献。"	2019-05-01	2019	02		10.27180/d.cnki.gjxzc.2019.000366

CMFD2020	武汉协和医院医联体建设研究	陈稳	华中科技大学	华中科技大学	医联体;;分级诊疗;;优质医疗资源;;双向转诊	"随着经济日益发展,我国卫生健康事业发展取得了长足的进步,规模与质量都得到了很大的提升。但我国优质医疗资源总体不足且分布不均,结构化矛盾凸显,医疗卫生服务的可及性和公平性有待提升,同时人民群众的健康需求也越来越高,导致看病问题成为社会热点。新一轮医改以来,政府着力优化优质医疗资源分布,提升基层卫生医疗服务水平,逐步提出分级诊疗的构想,并在实践中提出建立医联体促进优质医疗资源下沉,从而推动分级诊疗体系建设。目前医联体建设取得了一定的成绩,至少在规模上已经相当成熟,基层医疗服务水平在医联体的助力下也得到了一定程度地提升。但不可否认的是,随着医联体工作的深入,各种问题也在不断显现,比如政府主导不够,医保联动不足,双向转诊不通畅等,导致医联体建设工作遇到了瓶颈。同时,在实践中我们也发现医联体牵头医院的作用尤为重要,如何提高牵头医院的积极性也成为推动医联体发展的重要工作之一。本文以武汉协和医院为例,通过问卷调查、访谈调查、查阅文献等方式了解其医联体建设现状、主要方法、取得的成效、存在的问题和原因,并借鉴国内比较出色的医联体建设实例提出完善医联体建设的建议。第一部分绪论主要提出了论文选题的背景和意义、国内外研究综述等,其中国内外研究综述章节引入了华西医院、武汉五院医联体的实例加强阅者对医联体的理解。第二部分主要介绍武汉协和医院医联体建设发展现状,包括医院规模与医联体管理工作、医联体发展规划与运行机制、主要帮扶手段与取得的成效。第三部分为武汉协和医院医联体建设存在的主要问题,通过访谈、问卷调查得出存在的主要问题包括医保联动不足,双向转诊不通畅,人力资源不足,信息化建设不够,内部管理缺失,缺乏人员奖励机制,多点执业流于形式,人才流动不够。第四部分为武汉协和医院医联体建设存在问题的原因分析,提出原因主要是医联体政策滞后,医保倾斜不够,医院对信息化不够重视,政府投入不足,人力成本高,牵头医院任务繁重。第五部分是对武汉协和医院医联体建设提出的对策建议。本文认为,深化医联体建设工作,要从上而下,发挥政府主导作用,严格绩效考核,加强医保联动,完善基药配送,加大财政投入,重视信息化建设,同时加大宣传,规范医联体内部管理。通过医联体建设,引导人民群众有序就医,从而推动分级诊疗政策落地。"	2019-05-01	2019	04		10.27157/d.cnki.ghzku.2019.004591
CMFD2020	我国乡镇卫生院医疗设备配备与居民就医行为相关关系研究	崔文佳	陕西师范大学	陕西师范大学	分级诊疗;;农村居民;;医疗设备;;就医行为	"分级诊疗是推进医疗卫生事业向前发展的重要制度之一,其目的在于实现最高标准的医疗服务质量。然而在我国,整体而言医疗卫生资源分布很不均衡,患者多选择到大医院看病就医,导致个人医疗支出偏高,基层医疗机构资源得不到有效利用。城乡医疗卫生资源配置的失衡,资源利用不公平的现状又进一步导致乡镇卫生院、村卫生室等机构设备不齐全、医疗人员短缺、技术水平低下等一系列问题的出现,因此,卫生资源的合理配置,对实现降低医疗费用,让患者在适宜的地点获得优质的医疗服务,改善广大农村地区居民的健康状况等目标具有重大意义。医疗设备是卫生资源的重要组成部分,是影响农村医疗机构服务能力的重要因素之一,本文采用入户采访的形式,利用2011年国家自然科学基金项目的调研数据,对全国代表性5省47所乡镇卫生院农村医疗设备配备和使用现状做了深入调研,同时收集了 2028农户家庭的基本信息并建立数据库,了解影响当前农村居民就医行为的主要因素,采用问卷调查、多元线性回归分析等方法,对调研所得数据进行了回归,探讨基层医疗设备价值、配备和使用状况对样本乡镇卫生院就诊量、农村居民就医机构选择意愿产生的影响及影响大小。通过分析得出:1.乡镇卫生院常用医疗设备的配备量得到普遍提高,但不同经济地区之间差异明显,配备不公平、利用率低,如血常规仪、便常规仪、X光机、妊娠试验设备这四项设备在经济相对落后地区的乡镇卫生院配备率较发达地区低,有显著差异。技术人员配备方面,东部地区和西部地区差异性最显著的是血常规仪、尿常规仪、B超机和除颤机这四项设备。血压检测设备、血糖检测设备、血常规仪、尿检测仪、便常规仪、X光机、B超机这七项常用设备在东部地区每周使用超过5次的频率都为100%,清创缝合和妊娠试验设备的使用率也均为80%以上,而西部地区则面临较大差距,使用量都较东部地区较低。2.从乡镇卫生院角度来看,增加医疗设备价值投入、提高血常规仪、便常规仪、B超机、X光机、妊娠试验设备这五项设备在乡镇卫生院的配备率、增加血常规仪、尿常规仪、便常规仪、B超机、X光机、妊娠试验设备的每周使用次数都会对乡镇卫生院年就诊量产生正向的影响。3.从农村居民角度来看,增加医疗设备投入、提高X光机、清创缝合设备和呼吸机的配备率,增加尿常规仪、便常规仪、B超机、X光机、清创缝合设备、妊娠试验设备、呼吸机的每周使用次数有利于提高农村居民选择基层医疗机构就诊的比例。在文章的最后从经济、社会等角度出发提出了一些提高医疗设备配备和使用率的意见,为减轻农村居民就医负担、提高基层医疗机构的服务质量,政府应加大财政力度,从保障农村居民的根本利益的角度出发,制定切实可行的政策措施,吸引农村地区居民到乡镇卫生院就医,落实基层首诊制,不断完善分级诊疗制度提供理论依据。"	2019-05-01	2019	06		10.27292/d.cnki.gsxfu.2019.001032
CMFD2020	西安市社区卫生服务问题及对策研究	李瑶	陕西师范大学	陕西师范大学	社区卫生服务;;健康需求;;三圈理论	"社区卫生服务是民生问题的重要部分,党和政府一直对此非常的关注,它对促进公共卫生事业发展具有重要作用,是确保人人享有基本卫生服务的基础。尤其对基层民众而言,社区卫生服务承担着保障人民基本健康的责任。发展社区卫生服务对于缓解“看病难、看病贵”、方便群众就医、减轻医疗负担和建立和谐医患关系有重要的作用和意义。然而,由于长期受公共卫生资源分配不合理、自身发展和服务能力不足以及居民群众的不认可等因素,制约着社区卫生服务的发展。进一步完善社区卫生服务发展体系,一方面可以增进人民享有基本的卫生服务和满足健康需求,另一方面,有助于公共卫生事业发展取得成效。因此,有必要探讨和研究社区卫生服务这一话题。目前,社区卫生服务的发展和运行依然存在政策方面的引导、政府财政资金的投入、远行机制的不完善和内外部缺乏监督管理等问题和困惑,影响着社区卫生服务的效果。为了解社区卫生服务发展的困境,需要了解当前西安市社区卫生服务的发展、运行和服务水平的现状。同时,想要发现具体存在的问题,还要对社区居民和卫生服务人员进行实地调查和访谈,通过他们的真实切身感受发现问题和分析影响因素,还需要对以往的相关经验和教训进行借鉴和吸收,并分析问题产生的原因,从而合理地为完善社区卫生服务提出相应改进措施和建议。只有完善社区卫生服务体系和模式,才能提高其服务的质量和效果,也才能让社区居民日益增长的健康需求得以满足。本文以西安市社区卫生服务为研究对象,以公共产品理论、新公共服务理论、三圈理论为基础,结合西安市政府和相关部门出台的文件,分析了社区卫生服务的发展现状。其次,通过问卷调查和访谈法对社区居民的相关情况进行了解,以此来发现居民的卫生健康需求发生的变化,从以往关注疾病治疗到逐渐重视疾病的预防和身体保健等方面;也对社区卫生服务人员进行调查和访谈,并通过整理和系统分析收集回来的问卷,了解社区卫生服务发展的困境和他们的工作状态,发现他们需要提升业务能力和不断学习技术经验更好地为社区居民服务。在详细调查的基础上,通过三圈理论的“价值-能力-支持”框架,分析了社区卫生服务存在的问题,具体从社区卫生服务的公益性价值、服务的执行力、支持力量不足等方面进行阐释。另外,分析了影响社区卫生服务存在问题的原因,最后,结合具体存在问题、原因和三圈理论的分析框架对完善西安市社区卫生服务提出了对策建议,如重塑价值导向,需要完善社区卫生服务的基本功能和创新服务模式;提高社区卫生服务的执行力和监督,包括卫生人员的培养和政府的监督管理能力;加大对社区卫生服务的支持和宣传,既需要政府资金的投入和补偿机制,也需要对社区卫生服务加大宣传,获得居民群众的认可以及鼓励多元力量的参与。通过研究,希望为完善社区卫生服务提供一些新思路,促进社区卫生服务健康持续的发展。"	2019-05-01	2019	06		10.27292/d.cnki.gsxfu.2019.000544
CMFD2020	我国强基层的医疗联合体转诊制度设计研究	王啊涛	上海交通大学	上海交通大学	医疗联合体;;双向转诊;;制度设计	"我国大型医院和基层医疗机构之间分工不明确,存在相互竞争关系,一定程度上导致医疗资源配置效率低下。医疗联合体的建设是医疗服务体系供给侧改革的重要措施,有利于实现分级诊疗、双向转诊的治疗格局,提高医疗资源配置效率。当前我国推进双向转诊制度的最大阻碍之一是缺乏合理的利益协调机制。医疗机构的利益涉及医疗服务收入、财政补偿、医保支付等方面,双向转诊制度正是为了协调医疗联合体内部各级机构的医疗服务收入的分配。本文首先借鉴了Garicano等人提出的纵向转诊模型,结合国内强基层的医疗联合体实施经验,建立了符合实际情况的医疗联合体纵向转诊模型。然后,本文对模型进行简化分析,评价了两种常见的转诊合同(固定价格合同、收入分享合同)的有效性,并描述了联合结算模式如何影响转诊过程。最终,根据均衡所需要的约束条件,提出了有关双向转诊制度设计的若干建议。"	2019-05-01	2019	06		10.27307/d.cnki.gsjtu.2019.001071

CMFD2019	分级诊疗背景下重庆市患者首诊机构选择行为及影响因素研究	汪曾子	重庆医科大学	重庆医科大学	分级诊疗;;首诊机构选择;;重庆市	"研究目的分级诊疗的建立与实施旨在扭转当前不合理的医疗资源配置格局,解决资源配置不均衡,从而增加患者基层的就诊率,缓解大医院“人满为患”的就医压力,促进""小病进社区,大病进医院""的良好就医格局的形成。而患者作为医疗服务的利用者,其就医行为中首诊机构的选择直接影响到分级诊疗制度中基层首诊的落实情况。因此,本文在分级诊疗这一特定的背景之下,对重庆市患者首诊机构选择行为展开调查,重点了解患者对分级诊疗的政策认知情况,结合计划行为理论等综合分析影响患者首诊机构选择行为的个体因素、基层医疗服务可及性因素以及政策认知因素,深入探讨各因素的具体作用机制,从患者层面分析分级诊疗制度实施的现状与发展前景,找出问题的突破点,有针对性地提出对策建议,以推进分级诊疗制度的全面贯彻落实,进而实现医疗卫生资源的合理配置。研究方法1.采用文献研究法构建重庆市患者首诊机构选择行为理论框架,形成后续研究的基础。2.设计分级诊疗制度下重庆市患者首诊机构选择行为调查问卷,其内容从个体因素、基层医疗服务可及性因素、政策认知因素方面提出假设,采用预调查修改完善问卷后进行正式调查。采用分层、方便抽样方法对重庆市六区(县)一、二、三级公立医疗机构共24家当日门诊与住院患者进行调查,收集相关数据,运用描述性分析、卡方检验、二元logistic回归的统计学方法进行数据分析。3.对调查区县的的卫生行政机关的工作人员、医疗机构的管理人员和部分医务人员、患者进行访谈,详细了解访谈对象视角的分级诊疗工作的开展情况,以及在这背景下患者首诊机构选择行为的现状。研究结果本次问卷累计发放了1980份,收回1946份,剔除填写不完整问卷,有效问卷1878份,有效率94.8%。本次调查的1878名患者中,男性患者有806人,占42.9%;女性患者有1072人,占57.1%。患常见病多发病后倾向选择去二级及以上医疗机构的患者有758名(40.4%),倾向选择去基层医疗机构就医的患者有1120名(59.6%)分级诊疗政策认知方面,医保政策的知晓度为33.1%,满意度为50.3%,54.6%的患者认可医保政策;药物零差率政策的知晓度为43.2%,满意度为37.4%,45.8%的患者认可药品零差率的政策;基层首诊政策的知晓度为26.4%,满意度为48.8%,52.2%的患者认可基层首诊制政策;家庭医生的知晓度为44.8%,满意度为43.3%,67.8%的患者认可家庭医生政策;双向转诊的知晓度为24.3%,满意度为33.4%,66.6%的患者认可双向转诊。本研究分别从三个方面对重庆市患者首诊机构选择行为影响因素进行单因素分析,结果如下:第一,个体特征方面:患者的性别、现居地年龄、教育程度、就业状况、月收入对其首诊就医机构选择存在差异,差异具有统计学意义(p<0.05)。第二,医疗服务可及性方面:离最近基层医疗机构距离和基层医疗机构就诊时间差异具有统计学意义(p<0.05)。第三,政策认知方面:医保政策的认可情况、药品零差率政策的知晓度和满意度、基层首诊的知晓度和满意度、家庭医生的知晓度和满意度、双向转诊的知晓度和满意度对患者的首诊机构选择存在差异,差异具有统计学意义(p<0.05)。进一步的二元logistic回归分析结果显示:第一,个体特征方面:年龄越大的患者越倾向选择去基层医疗机构进行首诊;现居在城镇的患者比居住在农村的患者更倾向于选择二级及以上医疗机构首诊;月收入越高的患者越倾向于二级及以上医疗机构进行首诊。第二,医疗服务可及性方面,离基层医疗机构越远、基层医疗机构就诊时间越长的患者更倾向于去二级及以上医疗机构首诊。第三,政策认知方面,认可医保政策的患者越倾向选择去基层进行首诊。对药品零差率知晓度、满意度越高的患者越倾向于去二级及以上医疗机构就诊。对基层首诊政策知晓度和满意度、对家庭医生政策知晓度越高越倾向选择基层进行首诊。讨论和建议1.患者个体特征、基层医疗服务可及性和服务能力是影响患者首诊机构选择的重要因素。2.从政策认知对行为选择影响的角度来看,患者对医保政策的知晓度、满意度对首诊机构选择影响差异性并不显著,说明医保对引导患者基层首诊的实际效益并不理想;患者对药品政策越知晓和越满意,就越倾向于选择二级及以上医疗机构做为首诊机构,说明实施全部公立医院药品零差率这种“一刀切”的做法并不能促进患者基层首诊;对基层首诊政策的认可情况与患者的机构选择无关,是因为患者对政策本身的知晓度与满意度较低和基层服务能力不足;对家庭医生知晓度越高的患者越会选择基层进行首诊,说明提高家庭医生知晓度十分重要;双向转诊政策的知晓度、满意度以及认可情况与首诊机构选择无关,说明转诊制度本身还需完善。3.重庆市完善分级诊疗制度的对策。政府层面:完善医疗保障制度,助力分级诊疗格局的形成;完善基本药物制度,加强机构间药品目录衔接;加大信息化建设力度,优化患者家庭医生签约和转诊平台。医疗机构层面:加强基层医疗机构服务能力建设,满足患者就诊需求;推进紧密型医联体建设,完善信息共享网络。患者层面:加强制度宣传,促进形成分级诊疗意识;强化健康教育,培养健康观和理性治疗观。"	2019-05-01	2019	12		
CMFD2019	重庆市某医院医联体建设研究	刘起佳	重庆医科大学	重庆医科大学	分级诊疗;;医联体;;经验和不足	"目的:通过对重医附一院医联体建设情况进行实证研究,掌握医联体情况,总结其中的经验和不足,并结合重庆市医联体实施过程中存在的问题及阻碍因素,提出有针对性的对策和建议,为促进基层首诊和双向转诊提供参考,从而进一步推动重庆市分级诊疗格局的形成。方法:(1)文献分析法:利用知网、万方和维普等中外文期刊数据库,查阅国内外与本研究相关的文献,掌握国内外学者对医联体的研究成果,为本研究奠定理论基础。(2)案例研究法:本文选取重医附一院医联体为典型案例,总结其中的经验和不足,并提出相应的对策与建议,为重庆市医联体建设提供借鉴。(3)总结归纳法:对重医附一院医联体建设情况进行深入研究,总结其中的亮点和特色,结合重庆市医联体存在的问题,在重医附一院经验的基础上提出相应对策。结果:在城市医疗集团方面:重医附一院建成1+3+15+5格局的三级医疗集团。在医疗共同体方面:托管医院与179家乡镇卫生院和社区卫生服务中心组成医共体。在远程医疗协作网方面:160家医疗机构加入医疗协作网,覆盖重庆市36个区县和四川省、贵州省及海南省,服务总量超过25.1万例次。在专科联盟上:建成16家专科联盟,涵盖重庆、四川和云南等10个省市。在双向转诊上:从托管医院共转入患者2444例,从重医附一院转出患者2451例。在医疗费用方面:2017年,重医附一院门急诊次均费用为533.41元,人均住院费用为19783.61元。在教学科研方面:重医附一院帮扶托管医院创建重点专科、特色专科192个,开展新/特色技术1547项,科研立项732项,发表论文2972篇,培训进修生、实习生和见习生共17657人。结论:重医附一院医联体建设取得了不错的成效,实现医联体内制度规范、诊疗服务、数字信息、专家团队资源、急救网络、成员单位建设、医院文化建设和财务管理“八个一体化”。促进医联体内下级医院管理水平、诊疗技术水平、综合服务能力、科研能力、学科建设和人才队伍建设显著提高,为重庆市医联体建设提供了丰富的经验。但是医联体内双向转诊缺乏统一的转诊标准,没有明确的转诊流程、监督制度和激励机制。而且,医生积极性不高,转诊患者意愿低,医院科室不重视。在资源纵向整合、患者合理分流和医疗费用控制等工作上效果欠佳。因此,各级医院应在明确自己责、权、利的前提下,分工协作,提高基层医疗机构和偏远地区医疗服务能力,切实落实基层首诊和双向转诊,进一步促进分级诊疗的实现。"	2019-05-01	2019	12		
CMFD2019	重庆市主城区家庭医生签约现状及影响因素研究	彭小芹	重庆医科大学	重庆医科大学	分级诊疗;;家庭医生制度;;社区居民	"随着经济快速发展的同时,地区医疗差异却很明显。WHO在《2008世界卫生报告》中指出,初级卫生保健作为人为本的保健,过去重要,现在更重要。在2000年世界卫生组织(WHO)对191个成员总体绩效评估中,中国列144位,在卫生筹资与分配公平性的评估中,中国列188位,即倒数第四,这些数据与中国的国力相去甚远,医疗事业的严重滞后已经严重阻碍了中国的发展,关于医疗事业的改革发展已迫在眉睫。家庭医生制度作为分级诊疗的重要措施,能够有效减少“看病难、看病贵”的现象。但是家庭医生制度在发展过程中仍存在不少问题。因此,本研究对重庆市主城区社区居民、家庭医生及社区负责人进行问卷调研、访谈来研究影响居民签约的影响因素,探讨进一步改善家庭医生签约服务的措施,为进一步完善家庭医生制度提供一些建议与措施。选取重庆市主城区家庭医生制度实施效果好、中、差的3个区县9个社区卫生中心作为样本区县和样本社区卫生中心,采用方便抽样的方法,对561名社区居民和118名家庭医生进行问卷调查,利用描述性分析、?~2检验、多元线性回归分析对样本数据进行统计分析。同时对社区卫生中心负责人进行访谈,了解当前社区卫生中心家庭医生制度实施的情况以及遇到的困难与机遇。对社区居民进行基本情况的调查中,签约居民397名,非签约居民159名。其中沙坪坝区土湾社区签约人数最多,巴南区花溪卫生中心签约人数最少。女性占签约居民多数,占比54.2%。签约居民多为中老年人,签约居民职业多为教师群体。非签约居民多数为男性,职业多为工人或个体。100%的签约居民听说过家庭医生,85.5%的非签约居民听说过家庭医生,但对家庭医生的具体工作却不甚了解。77.3%的签约居民愿意续签家庭医生,78.0%的非签约居民愿意签约家庭医生。根据卡方检验的结果,影响签约居民续签家庭医生的因素主要是对地点、性别、受教育程度以及是否患有慢性病等因素。影响非签约居民签约家庭医生的因素主要是是否赞同先去基层医疗机构就诊、对家庭医生具体工作的了解程度以及家庭医生制度的宣传情况等因素。对家庭医生进行问卷调查可知,女性占比较大,为69.5%,学历以本科为主,职称大多为初级职称。大多数家庭医生所在的社区建立了家庭医生团队,但是由于家庭医生人数较少,社区居民人数庞大,工作压力较大。对社区负责人进行访谈可知,样本社区的家庭医生签约率在20%-30%左右,与北京、上海的家庭医生签约率有一定的差距。因此,这也说明了家庭医生制度在重庆的发展空间。通过实地调研可以看出,影响居民签约家庭医生的因素还是主要围绕在对家庭医生的认知度及家庭医生服务质量上面。社区居民对家庭医生有一定的认知度,但都并不深刻,影响了社区居民签约家庭医生的意愿。同时,社区居民还十分看重家庭医生诊疗质量。因此,政府应当加强家庭医生宣传活动,多开展宣传义诊活动,提高社区居民的认知度。同时,加大家庭医生培养力度,提高家庭医生待遇。政府还可以构建相应的奖励机制和配套的体制,引导家庭医深入家庭医生服务,保证家庭医生工作的积极性与后勤保障,继续深入发展家庭医生制度。"	2019-05-01	2019	12		
CMFD2019	重庆市医联体内分级诊疗实施效果研究	杜晓莉	重庆医科大学	重庆医科大学	医联体;;分级诊疗;;糖尿病;;效果评价	"目的:本研究以慢性病(以糖尿病为例)为切入点,分析重庆市医联体内分级诊疗实施现状。运用TOPSIS法联合秩和比法对医联体成立前一年、成立当年和成立后一年糖尿病分级诊疗的效果进行综合评价,讨论影响医联体内糖尿病分级诊疗实施的关键问题和原因并提出相应政策建议,希冀为重庆市完善医联体建设提供决策参考,为糖尿病乃至整个分级诊疗体系形成提供理论依据。方法:1.文献研究法。通过数据库检索与医联体、分级诊疗、效果评价方法等相关的文献资料,并对资料进行整理和归纳。2.问卷调查法。对医联体办公室负责人、内分泌科室医务人员、糖尿病患者进行问卷调查,了解糖尿病分级诊疗的实现情况,以及医患对医联体的认知与评价。3.深度访谈法。对医联体办公室负责人、内分泌科室负责人以及卫生行政部门有关领导进行深度访谈,深入了解医联体的整体运行情况、存在的问题及原因、分级诊疗的实现情况等。4.专家咨询法。在建立评价指标体系时,通过对公共卫生学、卫生管理学、卫生经济学等不同领域的专家进行咨询,确保评价指标体系的合理性和科学性。结果:1.基于TOPSIS法和秩和比法对重庆市医联体建立前后糖尿病分级诊疗效果的综合评价可知,医联体建设后一年的综合评价得分最高,建设前一年最低,一定程度上说明了组建医联体有利于糖尿病分级诊疗格局的形成。2.医联体助力糖尿病分级诊疗格局形成取得的效果:基层医疗机构服务能力有所提升,医疗费用增长速度得到有效控制,患者就医流向逐渐向基层倾斜,患者对医联体内就诊主观感知较好。3.医联体助力糖尿病分级诊疗仍面临诸多挑战:配套保障政策有待完善、医疗资源配置重心未下沉、结构性“看病难”问题未缓解、“上转容易下转难”现象依存、医联体内上下帮扶效果不佳、医联体内信息化建设任务艰巨等。结论:重庆市医联体助推糖尿病分级诊疗格局形成已初显成效,但是目前取得的效果处于低水平、初级阶段,仍面临着诸多问题与挑战。建议采取加强顶层设计完善配套政策、优化资源配置提升基层能力、明确功能定位促进分工协作、完善信息平台并加强监督考核等措施完善医联体建设,从而更好地促进科学、合理、有序的分级诊疗体系形成。"	2019-05-01	2019	12		
CMFD2019	成都市慢性病分级管理评价指标体系构建研究	刘丽	重庆医科大学	重庆医科大学	慢性病;;分级管理;;指标体系;;评估	"目的:在合理高效、客观公正的原则下,以定性、定量相结合的科学的研究方法,开发并构建一套适合于成都市慢性病分级管理的评价指标体系,便于后期通过评价指标体系去现场考评成都市慢性病分级管理,从而了解成都市慢性病分级管理现状,进一步提高成都市慢性病分级管理质量与水平,促进慢性病分级管理的可持续发展。方法:运用文献研究法、专家讨论法等方法初步拟定评价指标体系草案,之后运用德尔菲专家咨询法、界值表法确定最终的评价指标体系,采用相关公式计算专家权威系数、积极系数及协调系数的科学性,以德尔菲方法筛选指标体系中各指标的权重,确保各指标权重的合理性与稳定性,最终建立有品质的评价指标体系。结果:通过文献法、专家小组头脑风暴等方法,初步建立一级指标4个,二级指标14个,三级指标51个。经过德尔菲专家咨询的专业检验下,权威系数为0.8366,积极系数为100%,协调系数为0.354,第一轮专家咨询后,一级指标较稳定,二级指标淘汰了1个、三级指标淘汰了16个。第二轮专家咨询后确定了最终指标体系,一级指标4个,二级指标12个,三级指标37个,各指标权重分布在[0.0116,0.3217]之间,各级指标的权重整体波动较小。讨论:本研究集中对评价体系的构建、德尔菲方法的运用、指标权重的确定进行了讨论,构建的体系代表性较好、必要性高,能较好地反映现状,资料获得较好,实施可行性较强,指标专家咨询的权威系数较高,对研究的支持力度较大,各专家意见趋于一致,各权重的确定较为合理且波动较小。但由于某些指标信息数据可获得性较低,很难本着实际情况进行提供,且时间紧迫性和资源有限性,还需进一步探析某些指标研究的深度性、全面性。"	2019-05-01	2019	12

CMFD2019	民族地区县域分级诊疗体制改革研究	雷t	贵州民族大学	贵州民族大学	体制改革;;分级诊疗;;利益相关者;;民族地区	"随着我国经济社会的不断发展,公共医疗卫生领域越来越受到人们的关注。在医疗领域中,医改政策的制定或调整关乎着老百姓生活的方方面面,从我国新一轮的医疗卫生体制改革看来,解决“看病难、看病贵”以及医疗资源分配不均、医疗资源和人们的医疗需求之间的矛盾是改革的重点。与此同时,在我国民族地区县域范围内,由于自身独具特色的民族文化,显现在其独有的“医疗信仰”或“医疗习惯”中,因此,其医疗卫生领域有其特殊性。如何加强各民族团结、进步与共同繁荣,使各族人民平等享有基本医疗卫生服务,是我们党和人民政府始终为之努力的目标,而促进民族地区居民“病有所医”则是应有之义。2016年以来,我国大部分地区开展了分级诊疗制度试点工作,取得了一定的成效,同时也出现了一些问题。贵州省沿河土家族自治县于2016年年底开始推行分级诊疗制度,在2016年以前就已经实施了公立医院改革、建立医联体、转变医保支付方式以及建立家庭医生签约服务等多种制度手段,为全面推行分级诊疗制度打下了基础。本文根据公共政策利益相关者理论,从民族地区分级诊疗体制改革所涉及到的三个利益相关方(政府、医疗机构、患者)的视角出发,通过制定有关调查问卷以及运用民族学功能―结构理论,对贵州省沿河土家族自治县县域范围内的相关政府部门中工作人员、各级医疗机构中医务人员和患者三方进行问卷调查,并对有关人员进行个案访问,将所得问卷与当前我国其他地区分级诊疗体制改革有关文献资料结合起来,运用因素相关性分析法,分析其中各影响因素之间的相关关系,并进行结论总结。然后再次运用沿河县分级诊疗体制改革调查与个案访问的问卷资料,运用SPSS19.0描述性统计分析方法,对沿河县县域范围内分级诊疗体制改革实践进行评估。最后从利益相关者的三方角度,从我国民族地区县域层面,提出有关顺利实施分级诊疗制度的建议。由于民族地区县域在实施分级诊疗制度的过程中,受到当地风俗与人文环境等方面影响,改革曾一度受阻,因此,结合各民族地区自身的民族性特征,统筹协调好县乡村三级县域医疗机构,对民族地区县域人们的“医疗习惯”和“医疗信仰”进行积极引导,优化配置好医疗资源,发展特色中医药产业,使得医疗人才“下得去”、“留得住”,并通过信息化等各种新兴技术手段形成高效的分级诊疗模式,才是符合我国民族地区县域医改的正确“选择”,才能保证早日实现新医改的宏伟目标。"	2019-04-10	2019	08

CMFD2020	分级诊疗背景下基层医务人员工作满意度研究	丁厅厅	江苏大学	江苏大学	分级诊疗;;基层医务人员;;工作满意度	"分级诊疗是深化医药卫生体制改革、保障和改善民生的重要内容之一,特别是在合理配置医疗资源、促进基本医疗卫生服务均等化等方面发挥着重要的作用。基层医务人员作为分级诊疗建设的参与者,其认知和工作满意情况直接影响着分级诊疗建设的成效。因此,研究分级诊疗背景下基层医务人员工作满意度,对于分级诊疗的持续推进具有重要的理论和实际意义。本文首先梳理分级诊疗、基层医疗卫生机构和工作满意度等概念,阐述社会分工理论、利益相关者理论和期望理论等理论。其次,结合分级诊疗建设的实际情况,通过专家咨询与专题小组讨论,设计分级诊疗背景下基层医务人员工作满意度调查问卷。问卷采用Likert五分法计分,内容包括:社会人口学特征、政策认知情况、分级诊疗实施后的认知情况、分级诊疗实施后的工作满意度情况。运用SPSS22.0对数据进行统计分析,通过因素分析,找出基层医务人员工作满意度的影响因素。最后,针对存在的问题,提出提高分级诊疗背景下基层医务人员工作满意度的对策和建议。研究表明:分级诊疗背景下基层医务人员工作满意度总得分平均值为73.71±13.52;基层医务人员对分级诊疗政策的了解程度中,“完全了解”和“比较了解”二者占比为55.36%,其中,“完全了解”仅占14.99%;分析社会人口学的特征后发现,户口所在地、工作单位和平均工作时间对工作满意度总得分具有统计学意义(P<0.05);通过多重线性回归分析发现,以下7个因素:工作时间、福利待遇、工作负担、单位薪酬分配、基本药物制度建设、政府对公共卫生服务能力建设的重视程度和就诊病人数等,是分级诊疗背景下基层医务人员工作满意度的主要影响因素。在此基础上,提出以下对策:加大对基层医疗卫生机构的财政投入,加强基础设施建设,转变人才培养模式;提高基层医务人员对分级诊疗的认知水平,拓宽政策了解途径,提高政策了解程度;维护基层医务人员的基本权益,提高基层医务人员收入水平,改善基层医务人员工作环境;拓宽基层医务人员的发展空间,满足基层医务人员培训需求,改革基层医务人员的职称评定。"	2019-04-01	2019	03		
CMFD2020	基于生存分析的医疗联合体采纳与扩散研究	吴洋	昆明理工大学	昆明理工大学	"医联体;;分级诊疗;;采纳与扩散;;Cox模型,医改"	"目前,中国医疗服务业正处于传统与转型创新的交叉时期,传统的就医模式和卫生服务系统已不足以满足人民群众逐渐增长的高质量就医需求,需要探索新的医疗服务模式来解决现在的医疗服务困境。医疗联合体(简称“医联体”)的提出和建设是整合、合理分配医疗卫生资源的有效措施。2017年4月文件《关于推进医疗联合体建设和发展的指导意见》中明确了医联体建设标准,为形成有序就医的医疗合作网络提供政策指导。但我国各省份的医联体建设和分级诊疗机制的实施难度较大,在医院之间、政府部门和医院之间等出现诸多问题。根据社会影响理论,环境因素对组织或个体采纳行为的影响程度要远大于自身因素的影响程度。医院在选择加入医联体的过程中受到多方面因素影响,既有组织、环境因素,也会有社会、政策因素。因此,本文基于生存分析和创新扩散理论分析医院在采纳医联体的过程中的影响因素,并对医联体的运行提出相应的建议。在我国不断推进医联体建设的背景下,文章采用创新扩散理论和生存分析理论,把医院加入医联体的行为为研究对象,把医院门诊量、医院等级、信息化程度、建院时间、医院规模,建院时间×医院规模、地域条件和距离作为影响因素,并提出11个研究假设,采用生存分析法构建Cox回归模型分析医院加入医联体的行为。研究设计如下:首先,查阅相关文献结合云南省地理位置特点提取影响因素,设计调查问卷,选取云南省218家医院作为观测对象;其次,通过发放问卷和网络收集数据,对医院的基本信息和各解释变量进行数据统计分析;第三,运用Stata14.0,采用观测-预测曲线图和Schoenfeld残差检验对各变量进行PH假定检验分析变量是否符合Cox模型适用条件;第四,对不符合PH假定的变量采用Cox分层模型,其他因素使用半参数Cox回归分析;最后,分析不同条件下的Cox模型回归结果,验证提出的11个假设是否成立,并进行医联体的扩散分析。研究结果显示门诊量、建院时间、距离为积极促进因素,地域条件为显著阻碍因素;医院规模、信息化程度在组织因素的Cox回归中表现为促进医院采纳医联体,但综合考虑组织和地理因素时并不显著;医院等级对医院加入医联体的行为没有影响。扩散分析显示医院加入医联体的趋势还未达到顶峰,这说明医联体还处于探索阶段。基于资料分析结果,医联体中院间协同合作效率并不高,分级诊疗机制并未有效执行,对医联体的合作方式和发展还需进一步探索。最后,根据实证和扩散分析结果,归纳总结医院加入医联体的影响因素,为医联体的成员单位、主管部门提供合理化的建议,加快云南省分级诊疗机制建设。"	2019-04-01	2019	04		10.27200/d.cnki.gkmlu.2019.001244

CDFD2021	社会正义视阈下我国基本医疗服务体系构建与实现路径研究	任飞	苏州大学	苏州大学	社会正义;;基本医疗服务;;紧密型医联体;;分级诊疗	"正义是政治学研究的核心命题。古今中外的无数哲学家、伦理学家、政治学家都将社会正义作为理想社会的基本准则。当前,社会公平正义已经成为国际社会公认的价值追求,全面地嵌入到社会各个领域,卫生领域也不例外。政治学的正义研究与对生命健康的关注具有悠久的历史渊源,正义理论的每一个重要成就都能够应用于生命健康领域。从历史经验来看,健康正义的实现依赖于国家对于全体社会成员健康保障的制度安排。而医疗服务作为健康保障的重要内容,国家对于医疗服务的制度安排是否符合正义原则,在很大程度上决定了健康正义的实现程度。理想状态下,医疗服务是一种公共需要,应全部由国家通过制度安排予以保障。但现实中,当难以保障全部医疗服务时,国家通常是量力而行地选择部分医疗服务来向全民提供。而这部分医疗服务在国家制度安排下被赋予了公共物品的特性,可以称之为“基本医疗服务”。但不可忽视的是,基本医疗服务在使用时具有明显的竞争性和排他性。这就需要国家通过一定的制度安排来摒弃其私人物品属性,通过实现“规模效应”和提高“排他成本”来赋予其公共物品属性,才能体现健康正义。有鉴于此,政府遵循社会正义原则通过构建一定的制度安排来保障全体社会成员都能够公平地享有基本医疗服务,实现权利平等、机会均等、过程平等和结果公平,便成为应有之义。这种正义的制度安排便是本文的研究对象――基本医疗服务体系。从社会正义视阈对基本医疗服务体系进行研究,首先需要梳理相关的理论缘起。本文主要分析了社会正义理论、公共物品理论、制度变迁理论、公共选择理论及差异性社会理论对于本研究的重要价值。正义思想与人类历史一样悠久,并随着社会的发展而具有不同的内涵。罗尔斯的先验主义正义观和阿马蒂亚・森的社会现实主义正义观的理论养分的有机结合,为我国基本医疗服务体系的构建和实现路径提供了深厚的理论基础与切实的操作指导。公共物品理论的学者们则告诉我们:公共物品的特性决定了其供给的政府责任,同时提出了如何避免纯公共物品的“公共地悲剧”与准公共物品的“过度使用”和“拥挤效应”的思路。制度变迁理论对于原有制度变迁中的“路径依赖”现象的深刻揭示,对于基本医疗服务体系的构建具有重要的参考价值。公共选择理论通过对“集体行动逻辑”的阐释和政党、利益集团以及公共政策之间的传导作用分析,对于当前基本医疗服务体系存在的问题分析具有直接的帮助。差异性社会理论对于我国社会的“利益分化”和“社会分层”现象的描述以及“差异的正义”的论述,更加坚定了对于基本医疗服务的正义分配进行深入研究的必要性和现实意义。本研究从第二章开始聚焦我国的医疗服务体系进行研究。从我国当前医疗服务体系来看,政府无力将全部医疗服务转化为公共物品,仅能聚焦于基本医疗服务。这种现状具有深刻的历史根源和现实考量。从历史变迁来看,改革开放前的那种“国家统揽的、广覆盖式的、较低水平的、较强公平性”的医疗服务体系随着深刻的社会变革而逐渐退出历史舞台。改革开放后,伴随着我国所有制结构的变革、政府和社会关系的重新定位以及社会结构的不断分化,我国医疗服务体系逐步走向了市场化改革道路。虽然我国医疗卫生事业取得了快速发展和令人瞩目的成就,但医疗服务公平性也出现了下降,导致了较为严重的“因病致贫、因病返贫”问题。同时在城乡、地区、收入差异的影响下,不同地区医疗服务的供给能力、不同群体的医疗服务需求和获得能力都存在差异,而且这种差异因制度安排的缺陷被不断强化,更加凸显出我国医疗服务的供给总量不足与分配不均等问题的严峻性。经过认真反思,理论界达成了一个基本共识:医疗服务需要重塑公益性。但局限于国家公共财政能力,我国并不宜实行英国式的全民免费医疗,只能选择保障每一位社会成员的基本医疗服务需求。医疗资源的合理配置、就医的机会均等和结果公平,让有限的医疗资源能够最大限度地体现社会正义,成为我国医改的重要努力方向。在此背景下,我国自2009年开始的新一轮医改拉开了帷幕,明确提出将“基本医疗卫生制度作为公共产品向全民提供”作为基本原则,将“人人享有基本医疗卫生服务”、“实现健康公平”作为改革的重要目标。党和政府也始终对全体人民的生命健康给予深切关注,把“人人享有基本医疗卫生服务”纳入了《“健康中国2030”规划纲要》之中,上升到国家战略高度。新医改无疑是合乎国情和符合正义原则的。但面对区域差异和强大的制度惯性,国家对于基本医疗服务体系的改革显然难以一蹴而就。目前,新医改推行已十年,改革成效究竟如何?是否实现了改革目标?医疗服务体系存在的问题是否得到了有效解决?政府提供的基本医疗服务是否符合正义原则?倘若不符合,如何改革才能推进正义?对这些问题的研究和分析显得十分迫切和重要。在第三章中,本文基于社会正义原则对我国当前的基本医疗服务体系和改革实践进行分析发现,虽然新医改取得了令人振奋的成绩,基本医疗服务体系在社会正义方面仍存在四大缺憾:首先,基本医疗服务权利的正义缺憾。人人享有基本医疗服务的权利缺乏法律保障,不同群体在“个体差异、社会地位、经济能力”等因素的影响下,获得基本医疗服务的“可行能力”存在着显著差异,权利平等并未能完全实现。其次,基本医疗服务供给的正义缺憾。我国基本医疗服务供给体系仍存在医疗资源总量不充分、部分政策失灵和医疗资源配置失衡等问题,具体表现为:医疗服务供给者逐利的行为逻辑未根本转变、人均医疗费用增速仍高于人均可支配收入增速、利益集团吞噬了部分改革成效、地域和城乡之间资源配置失衡和不同级别医疗机构功能错位。再次,基本医疗服务分配的正义缺憾。分级诊疗消亡后重塑艰难,无序就医严重阻碍了基本医疗服务分配时的机会均等。重塑分级诊疗体系的努力,如多点执业、医联体等制度,仍面临着制度壁垒和实践困境。最后,基本医疗服务支付的正义缺憾。我国最能体现正义原则的基本医疗保障制度仍存在着“非全国统筹的俱乐部壁垒、平等原则下的公平缺失和非强制筹资破坏机会平等”等问题。这四个方面的缺憾表明我国基本医疗服务体系仍未完全实现权利平等、机会均等、过程平等和结果公平。那么符合社会正义原则的基本医疗服务体系应当如何构建呢?第四章从国外主要典型国家的医疗服务体系(英国的国家包办型、美国的市场主导型、德国的政府主导型、新加坡的公私功能互补性)中提炼出有助于推进基本医疗服务正义分配的合理要素,即权利平等、机会均等、分配公平、政府主导和尊重国情。在此基础上,本文提出了正义的基本医疗服务体系应涵盖“权利正义、供给正义、秩序正义和保障正义”,即从法律上赋予人人公平享有基本医疗服务的权利、以区域纵向医联体为单元重塑基本医疗服务供给体系、以强制性分级诊疗保证基本医疗服务分配公平、以逐步提高医保基金支付比例直至全额支付来保障结果公平。同时,通过对基本医疗服务体系的政治、经济和社会可行性的深入分析,可以发现:执政党对人民群众作出的庄严承诺以及我国政府所具备的主导地位赋予了该基本医疗服务体系的政治可行性,我国经济高速发展所带来的公共财政能力的不断增强为加大基本医疗服务的财政投入提供了坚实的经济基础,人民群众对于医保制度整合的期盼和改革风险的制度规避奠定了该基本医疗服务体系的社会可行性。但正义缺憾的弥补是一项系统工程。要彻底实现“权利正义、供给正义、秩序正义和保障正义”,需要对所存在的问题、面临的挑战有着清晰的认识,要坚持“改革和稳定的平衡”原则统筹推进:第一是加快立法进程,赋予人民公平享有基本医疗服务的权利。第二是加快资源整合打造紧密型医联体,强化供给对需求的引导作用;第三是实行强制性分级诊疗,以合理的程序设定化解无序就医难题;第四是完善基本医疗保障制度,全体社会成员强制性参保,建立公平的医保筹资方式,同时逐步提高支付比例直至全额支付。面对资源整合时条块分割的路径依赖、差异性需求下的共识分裂、逆向选择与道德风险、潜规则引发的过度医疗风险和政策实施过程中特殊利益集团的渗透与绑架风险,实现基本医疗服务正义分配需要由中央政府进行顶层设计,由改革相关方共同参与改革方案设计增强制度共识,以制度理性破除资源整合的体制机制障碍,以全国统筹增强基本医疗服务保障能力,依赖监管机制创新切断过度医疗的诱因传导,形成公立医院与民营医院错位发展格局,才能最终实现“人人公平享有基本医疗服务”的改革目标。"	2019-03-12	2019	06		10.27351/d.cnki.gszhu.2019.003768

CMFD2020	我国医联体建设和发展中的伦理学问题研究	常智风	大连医科大学	大连医科大学	医联体;;伦理学问题;;对策与建议;;卫生保健	"医疗联合体,简称为医联体,是当今医疗卫生行业和社会各界广泛关注的话题,也是我国深化医改的一项重要措施和制度创新。医联体强调政府主导,组织内各医疗机构资源共享、上下贯通等,旨在促进医疗卫生工作重心下移和资源下沉,不断提升基层服务能力,提升医疗卫生服务体系的整体效能。实施新一轮医药卫生体制改革以来,我国的全民医疗保障体系迅速建立和不断完善,基层医疗卫生机构的医疗服务条件明显改善,服务能力逐渐增强,但我国的医改进程中“强基层”是循序渐进的缓慢发展的过程。医联体作为医疗卫生资源优化配置的一种模式,有利于完善卫生服务体系建设,加快推进社区首诊、双向转诊以及分级诊疗的实施,有利于切实提升医疗卫生资源配置效率,在降低不必要的医疗卫生费用支出,实现医疗卫生事业科学、健康、可持续发展方面具有重要作用。目前,国际上很多发达国家建立了完善的医疗资源整合集团,我国虽然近几年医联体建设成果取得了突飞猛进的发展,但许多地方还存在诸如总体价值指向定位不准、医疗资源分配和服务缺乏公平性和公益性、居民对医联体认知度不足、医患双方的双向转诊意识薄弱、医联体补偿激励机制不健全等伦理学问题。医联体的建设与发展机遇与挑战并存,希望与困难并存。医联体的健康、良性运转,需要在实践中不断积累经验、提升认识,切实走出一条适合我国国情的医疗卫生发展之路。本文在阐述国际上医联体模式建设的现状和经验的基础上从政府、医院、患者层面上分析医联体产生的动因,揭示医联体建设的发展过程中所应遵循的伦理原则,包括公益性原则、以人为本原则、公平与效率相结合原则以及尊重自主原则,在此基础上运用责任伦理以及管理伦理理论分析我国当前医联体建设和发展中的伦理学问题,最后在总结出的医联体建设应遵循的伦理原则的指引下结合国际医联体模式的建设经验给出解决我国医联体伦理学问题的对策与建议:强调政府责任,维护医疗资源整合的公平正义;确证各医疗卫生机构的伦理实体性,促进各成员间责任利益平衡;“以人为本”建设医联体,构建和谐医患关系;明确个人在维护健康权中的伦理责任,尊重患者就医自主权;完善医联体补偿激励机制等。旨在建立一个公平合理、符合当前我国卫生资源分布现状的、可持续发展的医联体模式,通过搭建资源共享、利益共赢、信息互通、责任共担的平台,进一步完善医疗卫生服务体系,提升基层医疗卫生机构服务能力,使医联体产生良好的社会效益和经济效益,从而真正实现人人享有基本医疗卫生保健的目标。"	2019-02-01	2019	04		10.26994/d.cnki.gdlyu.2019.000215
CMFD2020	基于分级诊疗的三甲医院患者就医意愿与行为的调查研究	王晓雯	大连医科大学	大连医科大学	分级诊疗;;患者;;就医意愿;;就医行为;;影响因素;;态度	"研究目的及意义:了解选择三甲医院就诊患者的就医意愿与行为及其对分级诊疗相关政策知晓度及对分级诊疗制度的态度等的基本情况,探索在分级诊疗制度下患者就医意愿与行为的主要影响因素,旨在更好解决三级综合医院患者分流困难问题,以期为分级诊疗制度改革方向提供建议;分析医疗资源配置与患者就医意愿与行为以及分级诊疗制度有效实施的关系,以期为医疗资源的科学配置提供事实依据。研究方法:本研究采用文献研究法和专家咨询法自行设计调查问卷,通过预调查检验问卷信度和效度,以4城市5家三甲医院患者为调查对象进行面对面调查。门诊患者共发放调查问卷500份,回收有效问卷422份,有效回收率为84.4%,住院患者共发放调查问卷500份,回收有效问卷498份,有效回收率为99.6%。利用Epidata3.1录入数据并建立数据库,使用Spss17.0进行数据分析。运用频数、构成比、中位数等指标对数据进行描述性分析;运用卡方检验单因素分析、Logistic回归分析、非参数秩和检验等统计学方法对数据进行分析,P<0.05为差异有统计学意义。门诊患者和住院患者差异的各项统计指标差异没有统计学意义,故对其就医意愿与行为及对分级诊疗态度不做区分研究。研究结果:(1)患者分级诊疗制度及相关政策知晓度均较低,对差异化医保报销政策知晓度为55.9%;对分级诊疗制度知晓度为55.2%。(2)患者患病后基层首诊意识较薄弱:若患非急症,首选基层就诊的患者为41.4%;在知晓差异化医保报销政策情况下,若自感患常见病、慢性病首选基层就诊的患者为59.1%;若基层有支援专家坐诊,无基层就诊经历患者愿意首选基层就诊的占47.5%。(3)患者病情处于康复期下转意愿较低,愿意转诊到下级(基层)医疗机构继续治疗的患者仅有30.8%。(4)年龄、文化程度、职业、医保和基层就诊经历是患者基层首诊的主要影响因素;文化程度、人均家庭年收入、医保和差异化医保报销政策知晓度是影响患者下转意愿的主要影响因素。(5)患者对分级诊疗制度的态度支持度较高,对差异化医保报销政策态度支持度较低。(6)患者对首诊多持支持与中立态度,而对转诊反对态度较首诊偏高。(7)患者对基层医疗机构医疗资源配置不能满足其对常见病、慢性病诊疗需要的态度支持度较高。(8)患者对大医院看病难看病贵但有利于疾病诊治的态度与对下级医疗机构做过的检查转诊到大医院需重复检查的态度多表示支持与中立;对无论大病小病都挂专家诊的态度多表示中立与反对。研究结论:(1)患者对分级诊疗制度及相关政策知晓率低,政策宣传方式有待改进。(2)患者就医习惯尚未转变,急慢分治难以实现。(3)患者基层首诊意识薄弱,差异化医保报销制度对患者就医引导作用不明显。(4)基层医疗机构服务能力不足,向下转诊连续性受阻。(5)患者基层首诊与向下转诊意愿受多种因素影响。(6)患者对分级诊疗制度支持度较高,但对其核心理念理解度较低。(7)患者对差异化医保报销政策支持度较低。(8)患者对基层医疗机构缺乏信任感。(9)不同人群对分级诊疗态度有差异。对策与建议:(1)加强分级诊疗制度宣传,引导患者树立科学就医理念。(2)优化医疗资源配置,提高基层医疗服务能力。(3)明确各级医疗机构功能定位,健全分级诊疗协作机制。(4)完善差异化医保报销政策,有效引导患者科学有序就医。(5)改革人事管理制度,加速全科医师团队培养。(6)推广“互联网+分级诊疗”,加速医疗信息网络系统的建设。"	2019-02-01	2019	04		10.26994/d.cnki.gdlyu.2019.000380
CMFD2020	家庭医生签约服务制度的伦理问题研究	杨秋萍	大连医科大学	大连医科大学	家庭医生;;签约居民;;满意度;;伦理	"随着常住人口的快速增长、新城建设推进及老龄化问题日益凸显,基层卫生服务体系制度面临着新的挑战。而家庭医生签约服务制度,已然成为完善基层医疗卫生体系服务建设的重点。在国务院的医改办联合国家卫计委和其它7个部门一起发布了《关于推进家庭医生签约服务的指导意见》后,开始在基层卫生单位实行家庭医生签约服务制度,目的是在于完善基层医疗卫生服务总体功能,深化医药卫生体制改革,做到在新形势更好的维护人民群众健康。同年,大连市提出要全面推进家庭医生服务,本次调查研究就是在大连某医院的帮助与委托下,立足于当前社会热点问题,利用科学规范的抽样调查方法和统计分析方法,结合当今大连地区家庭医生的发展现状,以大连市已签约的社区居民为研究对象,从家庭医生签约服务现状出发,分析导致社区居民签约家庭医生接受及认知程度、需求及满意程度和其影响因素,探究家庭医生签约服务制度在实行过程中涉及的伦理学问题,并在此基础上提出应如何优化家庭医生签约服务的建议,希望相关部门采取有效措施完善优化家庭医生签约服务。同时在大连市乃至全国推广家庭医生服务的大背景下,一方面系统全面地了解大连社区居民签约家庭医生服务后的认知程度,满意程度以及需求情况,另一方面通过分析,在了解民情的前提下,促进家庭医生服务制在社区以及城乡之间进行推广,提高家庭医生服务质量,加快服务覆盖进度。目的了解社区居民对家庭医生签约服务认知情况、满意及需求情况,以大连市某三甲医院下属社区为例,探讨研究家庭医生服务存在的伦理问题,并为如何提高家庭医生服务质量和社区签约居民满意度提出建议。方法采用配额抽样法,选取该医院下属五社区610名居民作为调查对象进行问卷调查,使用Excel数据录入,和Spss20.0数据分析,研究居民基本情况、健康状况、就诊意愿、对家庭医生签约服务的认知程度、满意程度、需求状况以及各因素之间相关性。结果社区居民中老年人慢性病多发,比例高达社区就诊人群85.9%。对于家庭医生签约服务,有45.0%的居民表示只是听说过或是完全不了解,在已签约居民中,尚有40.8%的居民未接受过家庭医生诊疗服务、仅有27.7%接受过家庭医生上门服务,25.9%的居民接受过转诊服务,其中接受过服务的居民有62.1%对服务表示比较满意。结论调查发现在已签约居民中认知了解水平普遍不高,签约过后合理利用家庭医生服务政策居民也较少,接受过服务的居民对于家庭医生服务的满意度有待提高,其需求集中在对家庭医生的专业水平、服务态度以及医疗设备上。"	2019-02-01	2019	04		10.26994/d.cnki.gdlyu.2019.000216

CMFD2020	社区首诊制度的实施困境及应对策略	张伊格	华东理工大学	华东理工大学	社区首诊;;分级诊疗;;社区卫生服务机构;;政策	"看病求医,追求健康是人们的基本生存需求,而目前医疗资源分配不合理的现状导致“看病贵,看病难”的问题仍然存在,人们的基本就医需求不能被很好地满足。我国目前也已开始着手解决这一问题,全国多省市都处在不断完善和发展分级医疗服务体系的进程当中。在分级诊疗体系中,社区首诊制作为分级诊疗的基层政策,惠及面涉及了众多民众,但是其重要作用却未能得到充分发挥,而继续推进分级诊疗及医疗资源的整合则需要科学理论的支持。完善社区首诊制度能够有利于促进医疗资源的合理分配,提高基层医疗机构的卫生资源利用率,促使医疗资源下沉,避免大医院过度扩张。社区卫生服务机构强调的不仅仅是“治病”,而是可以利用自身便民、利民的特性为居民的日常生活提供健康支持,在疾病预防和治疗中发挥更大的作用,这也有利于提高全民的身体健康水平,完善新型卫生服务体系,为构建社会主义和谐社会奠定坚实的医疗卫生基础。本研究基于对上海市M区Q社区卫生服务中心的实地调查而成文,其间运用了文献法、观察法以及访谈法对社区首诊制度进行了研究,首先概括了社区首诊制度的实施现状,在此基础之上,从社区卫生服务中心开展诊疗服务的现状以及医患双方的访谈发掘其实施过程中出现的问题,并分别从政策以及社区卫生服务机构两个角度对存在的问题进行剖析和原因分析。研究发现,目前社区首诊制度的实施困境主要表现在社区居民参与社区首诊的意愿不强、社区卫生服务机构发展较为落后,以及配套措施不完善等多个方面,而究其根本,笔者将社区首诊制度发展不畅的原因归结于政策设计与引导不足、社区医疗机构受到能力和动力的双重掣肘三个方面,最后本文基于前文分析,提出了具有针对性的对策建议。"	2019-01-15	2019	01

科技成果	张小安	妇科肿瘤疾病的发病机制和宫颈癌分级诊疗体系的建立	郑州大学	妇科肿瘤;OCT;靶点治疗;分级诊疗	"本项目属于临床医学领域妇科肿瘤性疾病方向,主要目标是研究解决妇科肿瘤性疾病发病机制、新的治疗手段和防控体系建设这一国内外亟待解决的热点和难点问题。该项目在妇科肿瘤性疾病的发病机制研究中有重大突破,创立了全新的宫颈癌及癌前病变无创性光学相干显微技术(OCT)的诊疗方法,建立了妇科肿瘤性疾病的防控体系,制定了相应的干预措施,使妇科肿瘤导致的死亡率大幅度下降,在全省全国推广应用后,取得了良好的临床疗效。 本项目在基础研究方面实现了三个突破：一是首次发现抑制Annexin A2基因通过调控b-catenin信号通路,作为肿瘤发生过程中多种信号通路的枢纽在卵巢癌发病中具有重要作用,证实Annexin A2基因可能作为一种新的卵巢癌治疗靶点应用与临床。二是首次揭示抑制Cripto-1基因可通过降低MMP9、增加E-cadherin蛋白表达而抑制EMT的发生,从而抑制宫颈癌细胞的侵袭和迁移。更重要的是,本研究表明Cripto-1作为影响早期宫颈鳞癌患者预后的因素,为宫颈癌术后的综合治疗提供依据。三是首次证实APTO-253诱导KLF4表达可作为一种治疗卵巢癌的新策略,p53逆转剂CP-31398可能作为子宫内膜癌的治疗策略应用于临床,且研究表明,MiR-181a上调促进卵巢癌多重耐药细胞SKOV3/PTX的EMT的生物学进展,抑制MiR-181a表达明显增加卵巢癌细胞对化疗药物PTX的敏感性,有望将基因作为新的治疗靶点应用于卵巢癌多重耐药治疗,改善卵巢癌的治疗情况。 重要的是,创立了全新的对宫颈癌及癌前病变进行无创性诊断的光学相干显微技术(OCT),可实现对宫颈癌前病变进行无创、实时、在体、精确、自动化的诊断,现处于推广应用阶段。OCT光学扫描技术对宫颈病变中HSIL和浸润癌诊断的准确性可达85%,其中敏感性为80%,特异性高达89%,使检出率及生存率逐年上升,可弥补该领域在临床应用的空白,为国内首创,具有国际领先水平,此项技术对宫颈癌前病变的诊断应用前景巨大。另外,我们将HPV E6/E7定量检测技术及HPV16 L1甲基化检测联合应用于宫颈癌的癌前病变的诊断筛查,结合OCT自动诊断技术,建立宫颈癌三级筛查管理体系。通过建立宫颈癌的筛查防控体系,制定完善的干预措施,在全省全国相继推广应用,取得良好的临床疗效。 本项目以我院为中心,将系列研究成果及临床实践经验紧密连接,成果已推广到全国诸多教学医院进行应用,并一致认为该成果对临床具有重要理论性指导意义,在妇科肿瘤疾病的早期诊断、临床治疗等方面开辟新思路、新方法。该项目先后得到国家自然科学基金2项、河南省重大科技专项3项和省部级项目14项,获国家专利2项,科研成果7项,发表SCI论文70余篇,共投入专项经费1200余万元。通过妇幼联盟,以本院为中心实行分级管理,已覆盖全省18个市县区,256家网络医院建立了宫颈病变诊疗管理平台,建成全省管理体系,减少了妇科肿瘤疾病的病死率,在提高女性生存质量、节省医疗资源等方面意义重大。"	2019-02-25
